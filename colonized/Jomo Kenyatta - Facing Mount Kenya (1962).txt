INTRODUCTION
BY

B. MALINOWSKI

"A. NTHROPOLOGY

begins at home" has become
the watchword of modern social science. Massobservation and ' Northtown'
in England;
, Middletown' in U.S.A.; the comprehensive studies of
villages and of peasant life carried out in Eastern Europenotably in Rumania and Poland; the new drive in French
folklore undertaken by Riviere and Varagniac-all these
are directing the technique, method, and aims of anthropology on to our own civilisation. Even Volkskunde, the
study of the German people by German scholars, though
partly mystical and largely misused, is none the less an
expression of the sound view that we must start by knowing
ourselves first, and only then proceed to the more exotic
savageries.
In all this we do not even debate the point as to whether
an educated and trained member of a community is entitled
to observe it with profit and competence. We do not place
taboos on Psycho-analysis, because the psycho-analyst himself may be of the same race and culture as his patient, and
at times even in the same neurotic condition. We do not
send our Behaviourist to Central Australia because, being
white, he might be unable to study white children. The
~

English economist is allowed to work on the commerce
and banking of the City of London, and the French jurists
have given us excellent analyses of the Code Napoleon.
Yet when an African writes a book about his own tribe,
it seems almost necessary to justify his claims. I shall not
make any such attempt or gesture because, in my opinion,
the book speaks for itself. Mr. Kenyatta also does not
argue the point whether" Anthropology begins at home"
is as true of Africa as of Europe. It obviously is. Mr.
Kenyatta has acted upon the principle and produced an
excellent monograph on African life and custom.
As every good ethnographer ought to do, the Author
shows his credentials in his Preface. He has gone through
the African course of training. He became, later on, practically acquainted with administrative and economic issues of
East African policy. As to his training in Anthropology, I
can add one or two points which he himself is not in a
position to make. For several years past Mr. Kenyatta has
been a member of my discussion classat the London School
of Economics. He was thus associated in research and
discussion, in original contribution and extempore critical
activity with a number of brilliant, experienced and highly
competent young scholars, many of whom had done their
own term of field-work, and all of whom had had years of
previous academic training. In this group he was able to
play an active, indeed creative part, giving us illuminating
sidelights, inspired by the inside knowledge of an African,
but formulated with the full competence of a trained
Western scholar. The present book bears full witness of
his ability to construct, and his clarity of thought and
expression.
There is one quality in the book to which I would like
to draw special attention. Mr. Kenyatta is outspoken and

Introduction

IX

honest to an extent rarely found in students of social
science: he recognises the dangers of his own bias. "In
1 he present work I have tried my best to record facts as I
know them, mainly through a lifetime of personal experience, and have kept under very considerable restraint the
sense of political grievances which no progressive African
call fail to experience" (Preface).
In fairness to Mr.
Kenyatta, and as a matter of wisdom in any co-operation
between Europeans of goodwill and Africans who have
suffered the injury of higher education, we have to
recognise the fact that an African who looks at things from
1 he tribal point of view and at the same time from that of
W estern civilisation, experiences the tragedy of the modern
world in an especially acute manner.
For, to quote William James, "Progress is a terrible
1 hing."
It is terrible to those of us who half a century
.q"o were born into a world of peace and order; who
cherished legitimate hopes of stability and gradual developincnt ; and who now have to live through the dishonesty
.u«] immorality of the very historical happenings. I refer
In the events of the last few years which seem to demon'.1 rate once more that Might is Right;
that bluff, impudence,
;111£1 aggression succeed where a decent readiness to co•-pcrate has failed. The first seeds of this new historical
d('llIoralisation, let us remember, were indeed planted, not
I'Y Fascism or Communism, but by the frauds, the
imbecilities, and the impotence of democratic statesman-Jiip, which led us into the World War; there into the
"(I'olling injustices and betrayals of the Peace Treaties.
( .crman National Socialism and the other totalitarianisms
h.ivc been largely manufactured and fomented through the
illapplied brutality, then the weakness, of the Allied
II' <I icies.

x

Facing Mount Kenya

" The African is not blind," Mr. Kenyatta reminds us.
The educated, intellectual minority of Africans, usually
dismissed as "agitators,"
are rapidly becoming a force.
They are catalysing an African public opinion even among
the raw tribesmen. A great deal will depend upon whether
this minority of" agitators" will be made to keep a balanced
and moderate view of economic, social and political issues,
or whether by ignoring them and treating them with contempt we drive them into the open arms of world-wide
Bolshevism. For on this will depend the general drift of
African opinion from one end of the Dark Continent to
the other.
It is amazing how, for instance, the Abyssinian venture
has organised public opinion in places and among natives
which one would never have suspected of having any
complicated views on the League of Nations, on the Dual
Mandate, on the Dignity of Labour, and on the Brotherhood
of Man. But about Abyssinia most Bantu and Negroes
have their views. They have been organised into a hatred
of European encroachment and into a contempt for the
debility of those powers and movements which ranged
themselves on the side of Africa, and then through weakness
and incompetence, abandoned the cause of Africa and let
it go by default.
Again, the mismanagement of the
"Chinese incident" is uniting the world of coloured
peoples against Western influence and above all against
Great Britain and the United States, for even to one, who
is black, brown, or yellow, noblesse oblige.
Mr. Kenyatta has wisely refrained from using any such
language as appears in my last sentences. He presents the
facts objectively, and to a large extent without any passion
or feeling. That some of this is contained in his presentation of facts is a help and not a hindrance. For if the present

1ntroduc lion

Xl

hook does nothing mere but help us to understand how
A fricans see through our pretences, and how they assess
the realities of the Dual Mandate, it will be rendering a
great service. From this point of view the chapters on
land tenure, on economic life, on the marriage system, and,
last but not least, on religion and magic, deserve a careful
scrutiny. Any African bias contained in them is all to the
good.
There is perhaps a little too much in some passages of
Kurcpean bias. I might have been tempted to advise the
writer to be more careful in using such antitheses as
.. collective" Y. "individual,"
in opposing the native
outlook as "essentially
social" to the European as
"essentially
personal."
At many points unnecessary
comparisons are introduced and European expressions such
as Church, State, " legal system," " economics," etc., are
used with somewhat superfluous implications. When we
read of "a woman specialist • . . who has studied a
form of surgery from childhood," and who performs an
operation" with the dexterity of a Harley Street surgeon,"
I he picture is amusing but not helpful.
I am not aware that
,I lIarley Street specialist had ever been placed side by side
with the old Gikuyu practitioner to be compared with her.
Principles of asepsis are certainly not prominent in the
1 itual surgery of any African tribe.
In another context Mr. Kenyatta himself warns us against
Ihe dangers of misusing European
terminology.
"The
;lvcrage European observer, not trained in comparative
-ociology ... thinks of a tribe as if it must be analogous
10 the European
sovereign state." Indeed, to use such
expressions as " State," " Sovereignty," " Church," is only
profitable if these terms be re-defined completely so as to
make them applicable to the African culture.
In the

Xll

Facing Mount Kenya

following statement, however, Mr. Kenyatta obviously
runs counter to his own judicious advice and the rules of
terminological caution. "To make use of European
terminology, it might be said that religion in Gikuyu is
, State established,' but it would be even more true to say
that Church and State are one." Since,however, as we have
been rightly told, the word State cannot be well applied,
nor yet the word Church, while an Established Religion
carries with it a multitude of unnecessary implications, it
might have been better not to introduce a somewhat misleading and quite superfluous simile, and to describe the
condition in terms of concrete detail. This is so abundantly
given, however, that such criticisms are really due to a
cavilling pedantry which I am using on this book to express
my very high opinion of its quality.
The chapter on magic is especially important and
valuable because of the abundance of texts, of the details
given as to the ritual and the ingredients employed, and the
inside information on the psychology of act and situation
alike. Some anthropologists may question here the reinterpretation of the real processes which underlie magic.
" It can be safely said that this (i.e. magic) is one way of
transmitting thoughts telepathically from one mind to
another," we are told by Mr. Kenyatta. "It seems that,
through concentration, the magician or the possessor of
love magic is able to penetrate into the mental mechanism
of the person with whom he desires to establish communication. In this form the magician's suggestions are
easily transmitted by means of vibration to the brain, and
then to the mind."
I submit that Mr. Kenyatta would still have to supply
some evidence as to how these" vibrations" are produced,
how they act on the brain, and thence on the mind. But the

Introduction

X111

author disarms all criticism when he tells us: "There is
something in it which can be classified as occultism, and, as
such, it cannot be dismissed as merely superstition."
For,
indeed, how can we criticise Mr. Kenyatta for believing in
the reality of those magical vibrations and the possibility
of penetrating the mental mechanisms of others, in occultism
and telepathy or spiritism? How can we criticise him, and
exonerate the great English physicist who believes in tablerapping and spooks; or accept as civilised the two or three
of our present Cabinet Ministers who believe in Christian
Science, or the Oxford Group Movement, or spiritism?
Do the religious convictions of those who accept Hitler
as God, who have faith in the omnipotence of Mussolini or
i 11 the omniscience of Stalin, belong to savagery or to
civilisation, to superstition or to faith?
Weare thus led to the reflection that Europe is as deeply
immersed in occultism; that superstition, blind faith and
complete disorientation are as dangerous a canker in the
heart of our Western civilisation as in Africa. Indeed,
since we know better, and have all the means to combat
superstition among us, Mr. Kenyatta's somewhat ingenuous
remarks should lead us to search our own hearts and not to
indulge in another supercilious attack on the African's
liability to superstition. There is more superstition among
us ; it is more dangerous as well as more despicable than
.inywhere among the most primitive tribe.
The present book will thus be useful, inspiring, as well as
entertaining and instructive, in a variety of ways and for a
multitude of readers. It is one of the first really competent
and instructive contributions to African ethnography by a
scholar of pure African parentage. Through his upbringing Mr. Kenyatta combines to an unusual extent the knowI('dge of W es tern ways and Western modes of thought with

XIV

a training and outlook essentially African. As a first-hand
account of a representative African culture, as an invaluable
document in the principles underlying culture-contact and
change; last, not least, as a personal statement of the new
outlook of a progressive African, this book will rank as a
pioneering achievement of outstanding 'merit.

PREFACE
HE country of the Cikuyu,' whose system of
tribal organisation will be described in this book,
is in the central part of Kenya. It is divided into
live administrative districts: Kiamhu, Fort Hall (Murang'a),
Nyeri, Embu, and Meru. The population is approximately
one million. Owing to the alienation of agricultural and
pastoral land, about 110,0002 Gikuyu live mostly as
squatters on farms on European land in various districts of
Kenya. The rest of the population inhabits the Gikuyu
ltcserve and the towns. The Gikuyu people are agriculturists; they herd large flocks of sheep and goats, and,
I() a less extent, cattle, since their social organisation
requires a constant supply of stock for such varied purposes
as " marriage insurance," payments, sacrifices, meat feasts,
magical rites, purification ceremonies, and as means of
supplying clothing to the community.

The cultural and historical traditions of the Gikuyu
people have been verbally handed down from generation
to generation. As a Gikuyu myself, I have carried them in
my head for many years, since people who have no written
records to rely on learn to make a retentive memory do the
work of libraries. Without note-book or diary to jot down
memoranda, the African learns to make an impression on
his own mind which he can recall whenever it is wanted.
Throughout his life he has much to commit to memory,
and the vivid way in which stories are told to him and their
incidents acted out before his eyes helps the child to form
an indelible mental picture from his early teaching. In
every stage of life there are various competitions arranged
for the members of the several age-groups, to test their
ability to recall and relate in song and dance the stories and
events which have been told to them, and at such functions
parents and the general public form an audience to judge
and correct the competitors.
Like any other Gikuyu child, therefore, I acquired in my
youth my country's equivalent of a liberal education, but
while I lived among my kinsfolk there was no obvious
necessity for writing it down. But during my anthropological studies and visits to various countries in Europe, I had
the opportunity of meeting men and women who were
keenly interested in hearing about African ways of life.
I then realised the necessity to set down in black and white
the knowledge which had hitherto remained in my head,
for the benefit both of Europeans and of those Africans
who have been detached from their tribal life. Before
setting to work I realised the difficulty which faced me
owing to my lack of training in comparative social anthropology, and accordingly set about finding ways and means
to acquire the necessary technical knowledge for recording

Preface

the information scientifically. It was my friend and teacher,
Professor Malinowski, who made this possible for me
through the International Institute of African Languages
and Culture, and I wish to place on record my appreciation
of his unfailing help and encouragement, both in study and
in the arrangement of my material.
I wish to express my gratitude to those many friends,
both European and African, who have been good enough
to read and discuss parts of my manuscript and to give their
frank opinions of it. Their criticisms and suggestions have
been helpful. I am indebted to Dr. Raymond Firth for his
careful reading of the manuscript and his technical advice
on anthropological points. And to my brother Moigai
for taking photographs of initiation ceremonies and for
checking information on ritual points; and to my father
and other elders, who gave him their help.
lowe thanks also to my enemies, for the stimulating
discouragement which has kept up my spirits to persist in
Ihe task.
Long life and health to them to go on with the
good work!
Thaaaai-to the members of the Gikuyu Central
Association, my comrades-in-arms of the past, present, and
future. In this work as in all our other activities, their
co-operation, courage, and sacrifice in the service of the
Gikuyu people have been the inspiration and the sustaining
power.
In the present work I have tried my best to record facts as
I know them, mainly through a lifetime of personal experience, and have kept under very considerable restraint the
sense of political grievances which no progressive African
can fail to experience. My chief object is not to enter into
controversial discussion with those who have attempted,
or are attempting, to describe the same things from outside

XVlll

observation, but to let the truth speak for itself. I know
that there are many scientists and general readers who will
be disinterestedly glad of the opportunity of hearing the
Africans' point of view, and to all such I am glad to be of
service. At the same time, I am well aware that I could
not do justice to the subject without offending those
" professional friends of the African" who are prepared to
maintain their friendship for eternity as a sacred duty,
provided only that the African will continue to play the
part of an ignorant savage so that they can monopolise the
office of interpreting his mind and speaking for him. To such
people, an African who writes a study of this kind is encroaching on their preserves. He is a rabbit turned poacher.
But the African is not blind. He can recognise these
pretenders to philanthropy, and in various parts of the
continent he is waking up to the realisation that a running
river cannot be dammed for ever without breaking its
bounds. His power of expression has been hampered, but
it is breaking through, and will very soon sweep away the
patronage and repression which surround him.
The reader will undoubtedly wish to know my credentials
for writing the book. Merely to have been born and bred
in the Gikuyu country may seem to him a vague qualification, so I will give a more explicit account of the sources
of my knowledge.
I have said that as a boy I received the usual education of
Gikuyu boys, and the legends in the chapters on Kinship
and Government, and elsewhere in the book, are some of
those which I absorbed from my elders during early
training in custom and tradition, and later used to relate to
my juniors as an evening amusement.
The terms of
kinship are those which I have heard and used for years
among my own kinsmen. As my grandfather and father

Preface

XIX

were polygamous, I was born into a wide kinship group
with several degrees of relationship.
Following the tribal custom, I had to pass through the
several stages of initiation along with my age-group,
kehiomwere, and can therefore speak from personal
experience of the rites and ceremonies. Although men do
not witness the physical operation on the girls, they
are not ignorant of its details, as the young initiates of both
sexes talk freely to each other about it afterwards. Moreover, one of the operators was my aunt, Waco, and in
visiting her homestead as a child, I naturally picked up the
details of the process by hearing conversations between her
and other women.
I participated in the activities of my age-group, and was
chosen as its leader. Afterwards, through my knowledge of
Ihe outside world, I came to take a leading part in the
progressive movements among the Gikuyu generally, and
still hold that position. As the General Secretary of the
(;ikuyu Central Association, I started and edited the first
Cikuyu journal, Mulgwithania, in 1928-19)°' This gave
(Ill' the opportunity
to tour all over the Gikuyu country
and to meet many people, old and young, with whom I have
discussed various aspects of cultural problems, political,
social, religious, educational, and others. In due course I
have passed three stages of eldership (Kiama kia mbori
irhato), and this has enabled me to participate in Councils
c If Elders and to learn their procedures in various parts of
lite Gikuyu country. As a member of the warrior class, I
not only have a practical knowledge of the Gikuyu methods
of warfare, but have lived in the Masai country at a place
(war Ngare Narok, where I came in close contact with Masai
military methods and learnt much about them, and have also
visited many other tribes.

xx

Facing Mount Kenya

As for magic, I have witnessed the performance of magic
many times in my own home and elsewhere. My
grandfather was a seer and a magician, and in travelling
about with him and carrying his bag of equipment I served
a kind of apprenticeship in the principles of the art. Besides
this, I have lived in a place called Gaturi in Central Gikuyu,
a district well known for its magical practices, and there came
into contact with many magicians, or witch-doctors, and
learnt a great deal about their ways. I have also had
opportunities of meeting and discussing the subject with
other magicians, both from coastal and up-country tribes.
Information about the new religious cult came my way in
1930-31, on my return from a first visit to Europe. A
deputation from its members visited me at that time, and
I learnt much from them about their activities and
ideas.
I can therefore speak as a representative of my people,
with personal experience of many different aspects of their
life. Finally, on the vitally important question of land
tenure, I can claim to speak with more than ordinary
knowledge, as I have explained in a note at the beginning of
Chapter II. The Gikuyu have chosen me as their spokesman
before more than one Royal Commission on land matters.
One was the Hilton Young Commission of 1928-29, and
a second was the Joint Committee on the Closer Union of
East Africa, in 1931-32. Before this Committee I was
delegated to present a memorandum on behalf of the
Gikuyu Central Association. In 1932. I gave evidence in
London before the Morris Carter Kenya Land Commission,
which presented its Report in 1934. I have studied and
taken part in various discussions of this Report, and disputes
arising out of it, among others the one about the removal
of the Gikuyu people from their ancestral home in Tigoni;

fifes

Preface

XXI

matter which has been widely discussed in the Press and
the House of Commons.
I make special mention of these points, because to anyone
who wants to understand Gikuyu problems, nothing is
more important than a correct grasp of the question of land
tenure. For it is the key to the people's life; it secures for
Ihem that peaceful tillage of the soil which supplies their
material needs and enables them to perform their magic
and traditional ceremonies in undisturbed serenity, facing

I

Tribal Origin and Kinship System
HE Gikuyu

tribal organisation is based on three
most important factors, without which there can
be no harmony in the tribal activities. For the
behaviour and the status of every individual in the Gikuyu
society is determined by the three governing principles
which we will categorically enumerate here. The first
is the family group (mbari or nyomba), which brings
rogether all those who are related by blood; namely a man,
his wife or wives and children and also their grand- and
I;rcat-grandchildren.
The second is clan (moherega), which
joins in one group several mbari units who have the
s.une clan name and are believed to have been descended
(rom one family group in the remote past. It is obvious
I hat, owing to the polygamous system of marriage, a family
«'I' mbari unit increases rapidly, and in one generation it is
possible for a mbari to have a hundred members or more.
Thus in a few generations the number increases to several
Ihousands, which renders it impossible for a mbari to live
1« 'gether in a group where they could refer to one another
father, mother, sister, brother, uncle, aunt, grandfather,
I',randmother, etc.
When these identities of blood relations disappear, the

T

;1'-;

2

Facing Mount Kenya

only bond left between a group which once was united by
close blood relation is the moherega identity. This knits
together distant relatives and facilitates the feeling of
rendering mutual support in all important matters in the
interest and the welfare of the moherega. In perpetuation
of this feeling, representatives of a moherega generally meet
on occasions of big events, such as marriage ceremonies and
initiation or circumcision ceremonies. In such gatherings,
the elders bring with them a young member each from
their respective mbaris. The younger members of the
moherega are introduced to one another, and they are told
how their lineage links their particular mbari to the
moherega, This information is given to the youths so that
when they grow up and take the responsibility in the
leadership of their own mbaris, they will be in a position
to conduct wisely the affairs of their family group, and
at the same time to follow the correct line of their ancestors
in promoting the unity of the whole of the moherega.
The third principle factor in unifying the Gikuyu society
is the system of age-grading (riika). As we have seen, the
mbari and the moherega system help to form several
groups of kinsfolk within the tribe, acting independently;
but the system of the age-grading unites and solidifies
the whole tribe in all its activities.
Almost every year, thousands of Gikuyu boys and girls
go through the initiation or circumcision ceremony, and
automatically become members of one age-grade (riilca
rimwe), irrespective of mbari, moherega, or district to which
individuals belong. They act as one body in all tribal
matters and have a very strong bond of brotherhood and
sisterhood among themselves. Thus, in every generation
the Gikuyu tribal organisation is stabilised by the activities
of the various age-grades, of old and young people who act

Kinship System

harmoniously, in the political, social, religious and economic
life of the Gikuyu.
with these few opening remarks, we will proceed at
once to describe the " behaviour patterns" which are the
key to understanding the relationship existing between
various individuals within a kinship group. To do this
effectively, it is necessary to take as our starting-point the
tribal legend which will throw light on the origin of the
Gikuyu system of kinship.
According to the tribal legend, we are told that in the
beginning of things, when mankind started to populate
the earth, the man Gikuyu, the founder of the tribe, was
called by the Mogai (the Divider of the Universe), and was
given as his share the land with ravines, the rivers, the
forests, the game and all the gifts that the Lord of Nature
(Mogai) bestowed on mankind. At the same time Mogai
made a big mountain which he called Kere-Nyaga (Mount
Kenya), as his resting-place when on inspection tour, and
as a sign of his wonders. He then took the man Gikuyu
to the top of the mountain of mystery, and showed him the
beauty of the country that Mogai had given him. While
still on the top of the mountain, the Mogai pointed out to the
Cikuyu a spot full of fig trees (mikoyo), right in the centre
of the country. After the Mogai had shown the Gikuyu
Ihe panorama of the wonderful land he had been given,
he commanded him to descend and establish his homestead
on the selected place which he named Mokorwe wa
Cathanga, Before they parted, Mogai told Gikuyu that,
whenever he was in need, he should make a sacrifice and raise
his hands towards Kere-Nyaga (the mountain of mystery),
.ind the Lord of Nature will come to his assistance.
Gikuyu did as was commanded by the Mogai, and when
lie reached the spot, he found that the Mogai had provided

4

Facing Mount Kenya

him with a beautiful wife whom Gikuyu named Moombi
(creator or moulder).
Both lived happily, and had nine
daughters and no sons.
Gikuyu was very disturbed at not having a male heir.
In his despair he called upon the Mogai to advise him on the
situation.
He responded quickly and told Gikuyu not
to be perturbed, but to have patience and everything would
be done according to his wish. He then commanded him,
saying: "Go and take one lamb and one kid from your
flock. Kill them under the big fig tree (mokoyo) near your
homestead. Pour the blood and the fat of the two animals
on the trunk of the tree. Then you and your family make
a big fire under the tree and burn the meat as a sacrifice
to me, your benefactor. When you have done this, take
home your wife and daughters, After that go back to the
sacred tree, and there you will find nine handsome young
men who are willing to marry your daughters under any
condition that will please you and your family."
Gikuyu did as he was directed by the Mogai or Ngai, and
so it happened that when Gikuyu returned to the sacred.
tree, there he found the promised nine young men who
greeted him warmly. For a few moments he could not
utter a word, for he was overwhelmed with joy. When he
had recovered from his emotional excitement, he took the
nine youths to his homestead and introduced them to his
family.
The strangers were entertained and hospitably treated
according to the social custom. A ram was killed and a
millet gruel prepared for their food. While this was being
made ready, the youths were taken to a stream nearby to
wash their tired limbs. After this, they had their meal, and
conversed merrily with the family and then went to bed.
Early the next morning Gikuyu rose and woke the young

Kinship System
men to have their morning meal with him. When they
finished eating, the question of marriage was discussed.
Gikuyu told the young men that if they wished to marry his
daughters he could give his consent only if they agreed to
live in his homestead under a matriarchal system.
The young men agreed to this condition, for they could
not resist the beauty of the Gikuyu daughters, nor the
kindness which the family had showed them. This pleased
the parents, for they knew that their lack of sons was now
going to be recompensed.
The daughters, too, were
pleased to have male companions, and after a short time all
of them were married, and soon established their own
family sets. These were joined together under the name of
Mbari ya Moombi, i.e. Moombi's family group, in honour
of their mother Moombi.
The nine small families continued to live together, with
their parents (Gikuyu and Moombi) acting as the heads of
the Mbari ya Moombi. As time went on, each family
increased rapidly, and Gikuyu and Moombi had many
grand- and great-grand-children.
When Gikuyu and
Moombi died, their daughters inherited their movable and
immovable property which they shared equally among
them.
During the time of mourning for the death of their parents
they continued to live as one family group as before. But
as the number of members of each individual family group
multiplied, it was found impossible to live together and to
follow the system of classificatory nomenclature without
forming more family sets and clans.
It was then decided that each of the nine daughters should
call together all her descendants and form one clan under
her own name. Thus the nine principal Gikuyu meherega
clans were founded. The names of the main clans are:
c

6

Facing Mount Kenya

(I) Acheera; (2) Agachiko;
(3) Airimo;
(4) Amboi;
(5) Angare; (6) Anjiro; (7) Angoi; (8) Ethaga;
(9)
Aitherando. Besides these there are others which are more
or less variations of the original ones.
After the system of kinship was extended from Mbari
ya Moombi to several mharis and meherega, it was then
thought necessary to bring all these groups under one
strong bond of kinship, in which they could act in solidarity
and regard one another as members of one big family.
This large group was then formed and given the ancestral
collective name of Rorere rwa Mbari ya Moombi, namely,
children or people of Moombi or Moombi's tribe. In this,
women continued to be the heads of their family groups
and clans for some generations. But somehow the system
changed from matriarchal to patriarchal.
It is said that while holding superior position in the
community, the women became domineering and ruthless
fighters. They also practised polyandry.
And, through
sexual jealousy, many men were put to death for committing adultery or other minor offences. Besides the
capital punishment, the men were subjected to all kinds of
humiliation and injustice.
Men were indignant at the way in which the women
treated them, and in their indignation they planned to
revolt against the ruthless women's administration of
justice. But as the women were physically stronger than
the men of that time, and also better fighters, it was decided
that the best time for a successful revolt would be during the
time when the majority of women, especially their leaders,
were in pregnancy.
The decision was hailed by the men who were very
anxious to overthrow the rule of the opposite sex. At once
the men held a secret meeting in which they arranged a

}(inshil' Sjfster.n

7

suitable date to execute their plan. On the day appointed
10 carry out the initial stage of the revolt, the men started
10 act enthusiastically.
They embarked on a campaign to
induce the women leaders and a majority of their brave
followers to have sexual intercourse with them.
The
women were unfortunately deceived by the flattery of the
men, and blindly agreed to their inducements without
knowing the wicked plan the men had made to overthrow
the women's rule.
The men, after completing the first act, quietly waited for
the result. After six moons had elapsed the men then saw
clearly that their plan had materialised.
At once they
organised into groups and finally carried out the revolt
without much resistance.
For the brave women were
almost paralysed by the condition in which they were.
The men triumphed, took over the leadership in the community and became the heads of their families instead of
the women. Immediately steps were taken to abolish the
system of polyandry and to establish the system of
polygamy.
The men also decided to change the original name of the
Iribe as well as the names of clans which were given under
Ihe matriarchal system, to new ones under the patriarchal
system. They succeeded in changing the name of the
Iribe from Rorere rwa Mbari ya Moombi to Rorere rwa
Gikuyu (i.e. Gikuyu nation or the Children of Gikuyu).
But when it came to the changing of the clan names, the
women were very infuriated and strongly decided against
the change which they looked upon as a sign of ingratitude
c 111 the part of the men.
The women frankly told the men
rhat if they dared to eliminate the names which stood as a
recognition that women were the original founders of the
dan system, the women would refuse to bear any more

8

Facing Mount Kenya

children. And to start with, they would kill all the male
children who were born as a result of the treacherous plan
of the revolt.
The men were very much afraid of the women's strong
decision, and in order to avoid the conflict, they allowed the
original names of the clans to remain unchanged. And the
nine main clans in the Gikuyu tribe are still known under
the names of the nine Gikuyu daughters who were the
founders of the Gikuyu clan system. The proper names of
these daughters from which the clan names as given on
page 6 were derived are: (I) Wacheera; (2) Wanjiko;
(3) Wairimo; (4) Wamboi; (5) Wangare; (6) Wanjiro;
(7) Wangoi;
(8) Mwethaga or Warigia; (9) Waithera.
And these are the common women's names in the Gikuyu
society nowadays.
Up to this point we have been following the description
of how the Gikuyu kinship system was founded. With
that as our background, we will proceed to analyse the
behaviour patterns which govern the relations between the
members of one kinship group.
In the Gikuyu family group, as in other forms of tribal
organisation, there are certain rules of behaviour which
must be strictly observed in order to keep the group in
harmonious relationship.
These" behaviour patterns"
(metugo ya nganyiiti, as they are called by the Gikuyu),
are very important, and though fundamentally similar in
the family groups to be found almost in every part of the
world, they no doubt differ considerably under the influence
of such factors as patrilineal and matrilineal descent, the
division of labour and responsibility between men and
women in every society.
The Gikuyu society is organised and functions under the
patrilineal system. The father, who is the head of the

Kinship System

9

Llmily, is called baba (my or our father), ithe (father, his or
her), thogwo (father, your). The father is the supreme ruler
of the homestead. He is the owner of practically everything, or in other words, he is the custodian of the family
property. He is respected and obeyed by all the members
of his family group. His position in the community depends
largely on the type of homestead he keeps, and how he
manages it, because the capability of good management of
one's homestead is taken as a testimonial that one is able to
manage public affairs.
It is etiquette for a son or daughter to talk to the
father in a gentle and polite tone, and the parent, except
when reprimanding or correcting his children, is requested
by custom to reciprocate the compliment in the same way
as his children extend it to him.
The members of his children's age-grade address him
in the same manner as his children do. It is considered
impolite to address the father by his own name or names;
his children speak of him as "my or our father," other
children address him as " father of so-and-so."
Unless he
is a rascal, they dare not mention his name in private or in
public, except when mentioning it in a collective sense, that
is, in referring to the family group, such as Mbari ya
Moigai (Moigai's family), or Ng'undo ya Moigai (Moigai's
land), etc.
The mother is called malto (my or our mother), nyina
ellis, her or their mother), nyokwa (your mother). The term
" mother" is considered as an honourable form of address,
and one which is desired" by every woman in Gikuyu
society. When a woman reaches the stage of motherhood
she is highly respected, not only by her children, but by all
members of the community. Her name becomes sacred and
she is addressed by her neighbours and their children as

10

Facing Mount Kenya

"mother of so-and-so."
To maintain her prestige, she
must be hospitable to visitors and render assistance to her
neighbours when they are in difficulty or in need.
The worst thing that a man can do to infuriate another
is to dare to mention his mother's name in an indecent way.
This would result in a fight to defend the sacred name of
the mother. The great attachment and respect shown to
the mother by her children is due to the fact that she is their
nurse, and has daily closer contact with them than the father.
She feeds and looks after the clothing and ornaments of
the children. When they are in trouble, they first go to
their mother, to appeal or confess to her. If the matter
needs the attention of the father, it is the mother who takes
it before him and tactfully explains the children's needs to
her husband. In many cases the mother manages to get
conciliation between the father and the children and avoid
a conflict.
In a Gikuyu family, especially when there is more than
one wife, the mother is the immediate, head of her family
set, namely, her hut, her children, her personal ornaments
and household utensils, as well as her cultivated fields with
the crops thereon and granaries. In these respects she is
her own mistress as far as other wives are concerned.
The relations between wives are those of partnership
based on the collective possession of the husband, and not
on the ownership of the property within the precincts of
a wife's hut or granary.
The wives address one another
as moiru wakwa (my partner or co-wife).
Each wife is
materially almost independent of the other. The head wife
has no superior authority over the rest. But she is only
respected for her seniority in age, providing that she lives
up to it. Her main official duty in the homestead is to take
a leading part in the religious and other ceremonies per-

Kinship System

II

formed in the interest of the family group. With regard
to work, she does her own work in the same way as
the rest, according to the recognised rules in the
homestead.
The co-operation in cultivating the land, planting the
seeds or harvesting, depends entirely on mutual agreement
between the wives and their husband. Each wife addresses
her husband as mothuuri wakwa (elder mine or my husband).
The husband addresses his wife as mutumia wakwa (lady
mine). Collectively he addresses them as atumia akwa
(ladies mine). They address him collectively as mothuri
wito (elder ours).
This form of address is extended
symbolically to each member of the husband's age-grade.
And he, too, addresses the wives of the members of his
age-grade in the same manner as " lady or ladies mine."
The brother of the husband is given a nickname as a
sign of endearment. He, too, reciprocates in the same way,
and sometimes a present is necessary as a sign of naming.
The sister of the wife is addressed by the husband as
maramu, which is something like" my sister-in-law." All the
wife's other relatives, including her parents, are addressed
individually as mothoni wakwa, and collectively, athoni akwa,
i.e. my relative-in-law and relatives-in-law respectively.
The wife addresses the husband's parents as maito or
baba; i.e. my father or mother, as case may be. They
address her by her father's name as daughter of So-and-so,
this is a sign of endearment and respect to the parents.
We have examined the relation between wife or wives
and husband, and also between relatives on both sides.
It is necessary then to turn our attention to the social
behaviours existing between the children in a family group,
and again the relation between them and other members of
both paternal and maternal family groups.

12

Facing Mount Kenya

The bond of kinship between the children of the same
mother is strengthened by the mother.
Male children
address one another as moro wa maito, i.e. son of our mother.
Female children address one another as mware wa maito
(daughter of my or our mother). A brother refers to his
sister as mware wa maito, and the sister to his brother as
moro wa mauo.
As regard to seniority in age, the elder child is addressed
by the younger one as mokoro wakwa (my senior), the
parents refer to such a child as irigithathi (first child). The
first-born is regarded as a centre of affections and a precious
possession of the parents, especially that of the first wife.
The younger child is addressed by the elder one as moruna
wakwa (my follower or one who followed me). The last
child is known as kehinganda (one who closed the womb),
such a child is held dear, particularly by the mother. The
relation between the children of one father and different
mothers is strengthened by the father. They address one
another as mora wa baba (son of our father), mware wa
baba (daughter of our father).
The bond of kinship between the children of the same
mother and father is stronger than that of the children of
one father and different mothers. The feeling between the
former is that of inseparables, and it is said that, having
slept in the same womb (maraire nda emwe), and having
suckled the same breast (mongire nyando emwe), they are
one another's flesh and blood, and as such they ought to
live for one another.
On the other hand the children of the same father and
different mothers behave to one another in a different way.
The feeling between them is that of separate family sets
linked up and kept together by the father. And as long as
the father is alive, the connection-link is very strong. But

Kinship System

13

when the father dies, they are free to break up the common
homestead and establish separate homesteads together with
their respective mothers. After this the family group which
once was kept and functioned together under the father's
direction and co-operation, becomes two or three distinct
family units acting almost independently.
This is how sub-clans are started. In the first place the
sons of the same father and different mothers continue to
perform collectively their religious and other sacrificial
ceremonies. They do this generally during their lifetime.
But after they are dead the relation between their sons
begins to drift apart slowly until the divergence reaches
a point where collective action or participation in religious
or other private functions of a family is no longer considered
necessary. At this juncture the only bond left between
such a group of people is that of a common distant ancestor
with whom all commune according to the needs of their
particular family group.
In many cases, especially in a small family group of one
or two wives, close relation between the members is maintained for many generations, and the authority of the father
is always passed to the next generation through the elder
son in each generation.
In perpetuation of the kinship
system girls count very little on their parents' side; their
function becomes more important later on in their husband's
homesteads.
If a man dies without a male child his family group
comes to an end. This is one thing that the Gikuyu people
fear dreadfully, and it can be said to be one of the factors
behind the polygamous system of marriage. There is no
doubt that perpetuation of famIly or kinship group is the
main principal of every Gikuyu marriage. For the extinction of a kinship groups means cutting off the ancestral

Facing Mount Kenya
spirits from visiting the earth, because there is no one left
to communicate with them. And so when a man has more
than one wife and many children, his soul rests in peace
with the feeling that, after death, it will not be wandering
in the wilderness or lose contact with the earth, for there
will always be someone to hold communion with.

Relation hetween Children and their Father's Relatives
In the Gikuyu society behaviour towards the father's
relatives is entirely different from that accorded to the
mother's relatives. All his brothers are addressed by his
children by the name of" father ours," according to their
age in comparison to that of the real father. If it be an
elder brother he is addressed as baba mokoro (elder father,
my or our), the younger brother is called baba monyinyi
(small or younger father, my or ours). They in turn address
the children in the same way as their own. Sometimes these
relations depend on the position of the fathers, if they are
rich and entertain the children nicely they hear more of
" our elder father, our younger father," but if they are not
in a position to give the children treats, they hear less of the
beloved form of address. Hence a Gikuyu saying that
"Motheni ndetagwo bab« mokoro kana monyinyi," that is,
a poor man does not command the respect of being called
" elder or younger father."
The form of address used between the children of
brothers is that of moro or mware wa haba mokoro or
monyinyi (son or daughter of my or our elder or younger
father, as the case may be). Sister of the father is called tata
(aunt), the relation between her and her brother's children
depends mostly on whom she marries and the distance
between her husband's homestead and that of the brother.

Kinship System

15

If there is mutual agreement between the two families and
frequent visits are exchanged from both sides, the children
become well acquainted with their aunt and respect her as
one of the close relatives and one who entertains them.
But unlike her brothers, who are looked on as fathers
and have supreme authority over the children, she has
very little influence in affairs concerning the children
or the homestead of her brothers, except in social
functions.
Her children and those of her brothers address one
another as moihwa (cousins), there is a strong bond of
kinship between them, and whenever they pay a visit to
one another, the host provides a special meal for the guest.
Even when they are just passing by, it is considered as a
bad omen not to visit the homestead of your cousin or to
leave it without eating something, no matter how little
it may be. This is illustrated by a Gikuyu saying that
"moihwa ndaimagwo ronyeni," which means, a COUSin
cannot he denied a meal.

Grandparents on both sides
Grandparents are called gu.uka (grandfather) and coco
(grandmother).
The affection between them and the
children is very great. Symbolically the children belong
to the same age-group as their grandparents, the name
given to the first male child is that of his paternal grandfather, and at the time of birth it is announced that it is
" he " who has come. Similarly the second male child will
represent his maternal grandfather. In religious ceremonies
1 he children are treated in the same manner as their grandparents. The same thing applies to a female child. Owing
to the supreme authority which grandparents have in the

16

Facing Mount Kenya

family group the children, while with them, are given
the feeling that they are with their equals. Sometimes the
children spend more time with their grandparents, especially
grandmother, than with their own parents. A boy is called
by his grandmother"
my husband," and a girl is called
.. my co-wife."
The grandfather calls the boy wakine,
"my equal," and the girl mohiki wakwa, "my bride."
This form of address is, of course, used figuratively and as
a sign of endearment.
When the grandparents are not living near the homesteads
of their daughters or sons, the children pay frequent visits
to their grandparents and stay with them for some time.
Sometimes it becomes difficult to get the children to
return to their parents homesteads, for they feel more free
in playing and joking with their grandparents than they
would with their own parents.

Mother's Relatives
As we have seen that the behaviour pattern towards the
father is extended to his brothers and sisters, in the same
way that towards the mother is extended to her relatives.
The important members of her family group, who enter
into functions of the kinship system, are the father, mother,
brother, and sister.
Her mother and father, as stated
above, treat their daughter's children with great respect
and love.
The mother's sister is called tata, the same as the father's
sister, but the relation between her and the children of her
sister is entirely different. She is looked upon by the children in the same way as their real mother. The affection and
indulgence that she gives to the children and the sympathetic
attitude towards them is even greater than that the children

Kinship System

17

can expect from their own mother. Children like to visit or
to be visited by their aunt, and whenever such a visit is
made it is always an occasion of rejoicing and feasting.
The children of both sisters address one another as mora or
mware wa tata (son or daughter of my or our aunt), the
behaviour pattern between them is almost like brothers
and sisters.
The mother's brother, who is called mama (my or our
uncle), is the only one in the family group who enjoys that
title. 'For there is no uncle on the father's side. Because
those who might be called uncle, according to European
system of kinship, are called "fathers"
in the Gikuyu
society. The uncle's relation with his sister's children is
that of fatherly love and affection.
He has a certain
influence over the children. For instance, before children
can be allowed to pierce their ears as a sign of approaching
the circumcision ceremony, his permission must be obtained.
A gift of five sheep or goats is made by the father to the
uncle at a time when the permission is required.
Visits are made to the uncle's homestead, but not so frequent as those made to the mother's sister. The reason being
that in his homestead, unlike that of his sister who is ruler of
her house, the entertainment of the children is in his wife's
hands. And unless he has a very good and hospitable wife,
the children would feel rather nervous of visiting him,
except at the time of a ceremonial feast when children are
accompanied by their mothers.

Relatives by Marriage
We have discussed the behaviour patterns and terms used
among the husband's and wife's immediate relatives. But
as a marriage brings together all members of two distant

18

Facing Mount Kenya

clans, it is necessary to describe the relation existing between
the two groups.
After a marriage contract is signed between two families
all clan members of both sides become united. They
regard one another as mothoni (relative by marriage). The
behaviour towards one's relative-in-law is bound up with
the word mothoni, which means one who is bashful or
polite. Therefore it follows that every mothoni must treat
another with politeness. In the case of a woman the politeness tends to be bashful, especially in the presence of her
relatives-in-law,
She must not eat in their presence or
utter unpleasant words. She must cover her body properly
when sitting or passing near them. She must speak in a
sweet and polite tone when talking to them, etc.
The same thing applies to a man. He must show politeness
to his mother-in-law or any other member of her age-group.
He must give up his seat to her, get out of the way while
she is passing. He must cover his body properly in her
presence and not use any vulgar language while speaking to
her or in her hearing. The father-in-law may not enter the
house of his daughter-in-law before she becomes a mother,
and as a sign of politeness he must give a sheep or goat on
entering her house.
With regard to economics, both sides give each other a
great deal of mutual help. In agriculture relations by marriage generally help one another. Cultivation rights are,
moreover, given to a relative by marriage who has not
sufficient land of his own to maintain himself and his
family. There are numerous gifts exchanged among them,
especially in times of ceremonies connected with initiation,
marriage, or religion. For example, if a man is having
his son or daughter circumcised, and has not sufficient grain
to entertain visitors and friends who attend the initiation

Kinship System
ceremonies, he will send to his relatives-in-law to supply
the necessary food and drink, knowing that they would
ask for the same help if they were similarly placed. This
exchange of gifts is governed by the principle of " give
and take."

CHAPTER

II

The Gikuyu System of Land Tenure

T

HE rules governing land tenure, like many other
social customs, were taught to me by my father,
who is a landowner. As I was his first son he was
careful to give me all necessary information about land
tenure, to equip me to discharge my duties as moramati
in future years. In this way I acquired the knowledge which
is a normal part of every Gikuyu's education, especially if
he is a first-born.. But in addition to this I have been a
witness to many land transactions and disputes, both public
and private, in various parts of Gikuyu; for instance, I
acted as private interpreter to Chief Kioi in his big land
case which, after several hearings before the Kiama, was
brought to the Supreme Court in Nairobi in 1921. I was
elected as a spokesman of the Gikuyu Central Association
when we presented our case before the Hilton Young Commission in 1928; afterwards, when the report came up for
discussion in Parliament, I was delegated to present the
Gikuyu point of view with regard to land and other matters
to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1929, and have
continued to do so when the occasion has arisen. Because
of these experiences, my knowledge of Gikuyu land tenure
is not merely due to the fact that I am a Gikuyu, but is the
20

Land Tenure

21

result of great interest and specialised study, both of
recorded precedents and of those tribal evidences which
are handed down from generation to generation.
In studying the Gikuyu tribal organisation it is neces!;ary to take into consideration land tenure as the most
important factor in the social, political, religious, and
economic life of the tribe. As agriculturalists, the Gikuyu
people depend entirely on the land. It supplies them with
the material needs oflife, through which spiritual and mental
contentment is achieved. Communion with the ancestral
spirits is perpetuated through contact with the soil in
which the ancestors of the tribe lie buried. The Gikuyu
consider the earth as the " mother" of the tribe, for the
reason that the mother bears her burden for about eight or
nine moons while the child is in her womb, and then for a
short period of suckling. But it is the soil that feeds the
child through lifetime; and again after death it is the soil
that nurses the spirits of the dead for eternity. Thus the
earth is the most sacred thing above all that dwell
in or on it. Among the Gikuyu the soil is especially
honoured, and an everlasting oath is to swear by the earth
(koirugo).
Owing to the importance attached to the land the system
of land tenure was carefully and ceremonially laid down, so
as to ensure to an individual or a family group a peaceful
settlement on the land they possessed. According to the
Gikuyu customary law of land tenure every family unit
had a land right of one form or another. While the whole
I ribe defended collectively the boundary of their territory,
('very inch of land within it had its owner.
The following terminology is used to denote the landholders' position;
I. Mwene ng'undo or githaka, the individual owner of
D

22

Facing Mount Kenya

land who has acquired it either by purchase or through
inheritance or by acquiring first hunting rights.
2. Moramati, a trustee, who acts as the guardian to the
younger members of his family group.
3. Mohoi, one who acquires cultivation rights on the
ng'ondo or lands of another man or family unit, on a friendly
basis without any payment for the use of the land.
4. Mociarwa, a man who is adopted into the family of a
clan other than his own by means of a special religious
ceremony.
5. Githaka !cia ngwataniro, land held by two individual
families as joint property (this practice was rare).
6. Mothoni, a relation-in-law of the first degree, who
acquires cultivation or building rights, or both.
7. Mothami, a man who acquires cultivation and
building rights on the githa!ca of another man or clan.
8. Borori wa Gi!cuyu, territory of the Gikuyu, this term
denotes the political unit of all lands within the tribal
boundary.
The term emphasises that the land belongs
exclusively to the Gikuyu. Undoubtedly this is what the
Europeans have misinterpreted to mean" Tribal ownership
or communal land."
Having given these outlines, we will at once proceed to
describe how the land was originally acquired and the
traditional sanctions under which the Gikuyu system ofland
tenure was maintained prior to the coming of the Europeans
into the country. To do this effectively it is best to start
from a tribal legend connected with the old man Gikuyu,
the founder of the tribe, from whose name that of the
country and of the people is derived.
According to the tribal legend, which as a boy I heard
from my grandfather's talk with other elders, and which
many of our people are familiar with, we are told that from

Land Tenure

23

the beginning of things, Ngai or Mogai (God or Divider or
Benefactor), when he was dividing the world into territories
and giving them to the various races and nations that
populate the globe, gave the man Gikuyu a territory full
of the good things of nature. The Mogai commanded
Gikuyu to establish a home for himself and his descendants.
Gikuyu and his wife, Moornbi, built their first homestead at
a place called Mokorwe wa Gathanga, and had many
children. As time went on, the people increased rapidly
owing to the multiplicity of wives and good nourishment
from the soil. Soon the land, which was held as the family
land, became densely populated. For this reason some of
the people decided to move southward and try to acquire
more lands from the forest dwellers.
In the forests there lived a race of people called Gumba
(pigmy), who were engaged in hunting. They were very
short and strong. Their homes were built underground,
they were shy and did not like to mix freely with the
strangers. To avoid meeting other people they dug tunnels
(miungu) connecting different sections of their underground
villages. As soon as they saw a stranger they ran into the
tunnels, which were cunningly concealed; then they would
run quickly underground and reappear at the other end.
The Gikuyu were very much astonished, for they thought
that these people had magic of opening the earth and
disappearing therein at will.
As far as the story of these people goes, there is no
clear indication of any land transactions between them and
the Gikuyu people, but it is said that they disappeared
underground and no one knows what became of them.
Their disappearance is attributed to the failure of their
magic, which they used to perform while entering into
their underground homes. And it is supposed that when

24

Facing Mount Kenya

the earth swallowed them, they were not able to perform
their magic to permit them to return to the surface.
Our theory on this question is that it is not likely that
this race of early hunters was swallowed by the earth,
as we are led to believe by the tribal legend, but that there
are two ways in which the disappearance of the Gumba
could definitely be explained. Firstly, that they moved
farther west towards the Congo forests where similar types
of people are to be found. But when we consider the
distance between the Congo forest and the Gikuyu country,
and the hardship which the Gumba would have encountered
on their journey to Congo, we are inclined to think that
the movement did not take place.
If that is so, then the only possible way to account for
the disappearance of the Gumba is, that they inter-married
with the early Gikuyu pioneers who ventured into the forests,
and perhaps lost their contact with the other main sections
of the Gikuyu, and, therefore, settled in the forests in the
same way as Gumba.
There is strong reason to support the latter theory, for
soon after the Gumba had disappeared as a race, there came
into being another race of hunters known as Ndorobo or
Aathi, who seemed to have grown like mushrooms in
the forests. Unlike their predecessors, they were not short
in stature, but something between the Gumba and .the
Gikuyu. Also they did not live underground, but built
their homes on the surface, almost on similar lines to those
of the Gikuyu homesteads.
Their language, too, was
similar to the Gikuyu. To a certain extent the two tribes
could understand one another with little difficulty.
With these evidences it would 110tbe assuming too much
to say that the interbreeding between the Gumba and the
Gikuyu was responsible for the disappearance of the Gumba

Land Tenure
as a distinct race, and the producing of the Ndorobo or
Aathi, who became the new owners and the masters of the
forests, as we shall see later.
The Ndorobo established friendly relations with the
Gikuyu, and, as the people continued to move southwards,
land transactions started between the two tribes who lived
side by side. The Ndorobo were not interested in cultivating the land, their main occupation was hunting and
collecting wild honey in the forests. Apart from land
transactions they traded with the Gikuyu. They sold by
barter their honey and skins of animals to the Gikuyu,
who in turn gave the Ndorobo grains, yams, sugar-canes,
bananas, and other fruits of the soil.
As the time went on the Gikuyu, who had not enough
land to cultivate in the congested areas, started to buy lands
from the N dorobo. All the lands which were bought in
this way were held under private ownership or as a family
joint property.
In fact, there was not in any part of the
Gikuyu, as far as memory goes, any land that belonged to
everybody, or what is called "no man's land."
The
term "communal or tribal ownership of land" has been
misused in describing the land, as though the whole of it
was owned collectively by every member of the community.
The Gikuyu defended their country collectively, and
when talking to a stranger they would refer to the country,
land, and everything else as" ours," borori wiito or borori wa
Gikuyu, to show the unity among the people. But the fact
remained that every inch of the Gikuyu territory had its
owner, with the boundary properly fixed and everyone
respecting his neighbour's.
In the Report on the Gikuyu
Land Tenure, paragraph 22, it is recorded that: "--there
are several places in the Nyeri and Fort Hall districts where
(JOe may stand and see more than a thousand acres at a

Facing Mount Kenya
stretch with scarcely an acre uncultivated, and the disputes
which occur, though complicated and troublesome, are
surprisingly few." In former days no man could dare go
and cultivate another man's land without first obtaining the
necessary permission from the rightful owner or owners.
The sense of private property vested in the family was so
highly developed among the Gikuyu, but the form of
private ownership in the Gikuyu community did not
necessarily mean the exclusive use of the land by the
owner, or the extorting of rents from those who wanted to
have cultivation or building rights. In other words, it was
a man's pride to own a property and his enjoyment to allow
collective use of such property. This sense of hospitality
which facilitated the communal use of almost everything, has been mistaken by the Europeans who misinterpreted it by saying that the land was under the communal
or tribal ownership, and as such the land must be mali ya
serikali, which means Government property.
Having
coined this new terminology of land tenure, the British
Government began to drive away the original owners of
land.
In the following pages we will describe the system of
land tenure, showing how the land was first acquired, and
how it passed from individual ownership to family or clan
ownership. In doing so we will base our analysis on the
eight different types of land holding or land rights.
In dealing with the private ownership of land we will
begin our 'description from the time when the Gikuyu
people started to move southward and established contact with the Ndorobo, from whom the land, especially
in South Gikuyu, was bought. Before this time, although
some form of private ownership of land existed, the system
was not so obvious, as there was no property exchanged in

Land Tenure
acquiring the possession of the land. In the first place the
land was given to the Gikuyu by the Mogai, the Lord of
Nature. Secondly, by the fact that the Gikuyu was the
first to establish his homestead on the land. Thirdly, that
when the people started to multiply and to form their own
individual family groups, each family group pegged out a
portion of the forest and reserved the first rights of cultivation and hunting therein. In those days the claim of having
cleared the original forest was the basic principle of absolute
ownership of land. In other words, a man acquired the
right to own the land through the labour he spent in developing it. For this reason it was necessary for the whole family
to join forces in order to clear sufficient land for their
present and future needs. Fourthly, when the land which
the Mogai had given to the Gikuyu was thickly populated
and no more forests left to be pegged out, people moved
towards the forests in the south. Here the forests having
been owned by the Ndorobo, there was no possibility of a
man just going into the forest and establishing his claims by
merely clearing the original forest. This being the case,
the Gikuyu who were anxious to own the land, on seeing
that the N dorobo were willing to sell, at once started to
purchase it. Thus a new form came into being, of owning
the land by purchase, instead of owning by acquiring the
first rights of hunting or clearing the original forests.
In order to clarify the two systems last mentioned,
under which the lands were acquired, let us take the words
from the Report on the Gikuyu Land Tenure issued in
1929. On paragraph 24 the following statement is made:
" It is most interesting to consider why it is that the tribal
theory is in most respects intact in Nyeri and Fort Hall,
while in Kiambu it has been modified greatly in favour of
the individual owner-cultivator and the sectional head,"

Facing Mount Kenya
The reason for this difference is that in Nyeri and Fort
Hall there hardly existed any land transaction between
the Gikuyu and Ndorobo, and even if any purchase of
land from the Ndorobo had taken place in these districts it
would have happened so far in the remote past that the
incident had faded from the memory of the present generation. Most probably there were no Ndorobo in either Fort
Hall or Nyeri, for the Mokorwe wa Gathanga, the place
where the Gikuyu are believed to have originated, is somewhere in these districts. If that is so, there could not have
been any land transactions between the Gikuyu in the two
districts and the Ndorobo, unless there is evidence to prove
that both the Gikuyu and the N dorobo originated at
the same place. But as far as we are aware, there is no such
evidence in the tribal historical legends.
The next point in connection with the slight difference
between the system of land tenure in the Kiambu district
and that which exists in the Nyeri and Fort Hall districts,
is that in the former case the land was actually bought from
the Ndorobo.
In the Kiambu district the land transaction between the Gikuyu and the Ndorobo is a recent
occurrence, and there are people still living who took part
in purchasing the land from the N dorobo.
At the same time there are single families who bought
the land, and as they have not yet increased to form a clan
unit the land is still in the hands of the first purchaser, and
as such he has the rights of private ownership. For example,
if a man whom we will call A bought land before he was
married, that land was his own private property during his
bachelorhood. When he married B, the land became the joint
property of husband and wife. In this case we will assume
that A had no relatives or he was independent of such
relatives. He cleared a part of his land for his wife to

Land Tenure
cultivate, that part cultivated by his wife became her own
or she had full cultivation rights, while the soil still remained
the property of the husband. Let us say that a man had
sixty acres of land, the first wife might have cultivated two
acres, she would refer to this part as "my garden"
(mogonJa wakwa), and the rest as "our land" (githaka
giito). Next A marries a second wife C, he clears another
part of his land for her in the same way as for B. The land
which remained uncultivated belonged to all three. The
wives could call it " our land," while their husband called
it cc my land" (githaka giakwa). Now each wife had her
garden or gardens according to her capacity in cultivation.
No one, except perhaps her husband, would encroach upon
her cultivated pieces of land. If any of the wives wanted a
new garden, her husband would clear another piece from the
uncultivated land.
After some time the family began to increase. Let us
imagine that each wife had three sons and perhaps some
daughters. But as female children do not take part in the
ownership of land, we will leave them out, because, having
no system of spinsterhood in the Gikuyu society, women
do not inherit land on their father's side; they play their
part in the family or clan in which they marry.
To return to our analysis, Mr. A with his two wives B
and C had six sons. The sons following their father's
example married two wives each. In this way the land
which used t? be the private property of Mr. A, and of
which he had absolute ownership, was now shared by
several persons who had full cultivation rights, namely,
the father, his two wives, the six sons with their twelve
wives, making a total of twenty persons who called the
land " ours," and the father who retained the title of " my
land" (ng'onJo yakwa).

30

Facing Mount Kenya

For our analysis let us suppose that the twelve wives
followed the example of their mothers-in-law and had an
average of three sons each, this would bring the number
of the land claimants to fifty-six persons, all having full
cultivation rights, and each regarding the piece under
cultivation as "my garden," and the other uncultivated
land or fallow land regarded by all collectively as "our
land," while Mr. A still called the whole of the land
"my land." If we take daughters into consideration, as
they also had to use land before marriage, we will find
that while Mr. A was still living he might have had about
seventy people or more of his own as nucleus of his mbari
or clan unit.
As time went on this group of people became a big
community and the land which all regarded as " our land"
could no more support them. When a family group reached
this point, the more prosperous members of it went and
bought lands somewhere else and started the same proceeding as we have already described; but those who
were not in a position to buy land became ahoi or
athami, i.e. they acquired cultivation or building rights
on the lands belonging to another family group or clan
unit.
The above description gives a clear picture contradicting
what is called communal ownership of land, a term which
presupposes that the land belonged to every Dick and Harry
in the community. This could not be the case for, as we
have shown, the land did not belong to the community as
such, but to some individual founders of various families
who had the full rights of ownership and the control of
the land.
Unlike the European, the African kinship tie is so strong
that all a man's children and grandchildren, including great-

Land Tenure

31

1',I,llldchildren, are considered as forming the family
l'I'HI(1,and as such they must stick together.
'1',) clarify the above statement let us take the case of a man
II,II(I bought or acquired the first hunting rights of land
while a bachelor, and was afterwards forced by circum''',lIlces to become monogamous instead of polygamous.
III t his case we will suggest that fate so decided that the
111,111 had only one son and many daughters, which means
111.11 there were only two persons who could call the land
.. ours " and the father who called it " mine," and who had
filii or outright ownership of that particular land. On his
ci(';lIh he transferred his rights to his son according to the
, 1I',Iomary law of inheritance.
So it is clear that unless
rlll'rc were many sons in a family group, the land remained
rill' private property of the man who bought it or of his
'" III who inherited it.

Buying and Selling of Land
After the land was bought from Ndoroho, any man who
lu-kl such land, through purchase or inheritance, had full
l'I',llts to sell it outright or give it to anyone as he liked
without consulting anyone, except the elders who acted as
til(' ceremonial witnesses in all land transactions.
By
ruhcritance we mean a single son inheriting the land from
Iii:; father who had no other relatives.
When a man has many sons he is no .more alone, his
IIll<'rcsts are interwoven with those of his children, and
',111(,(' they are flesh of his flesh, bone of his bones, he shares
Iii" land and all his property with them. He could not sell
III'. land without consulting them unless he was a very
1',111 man, who did not care for the future of his family.
c ,I';(,S of this nature are very rare in the Gikuyu community

32

Facing Mount Kenya

but even when it occurred the elders of the village or district
would intervene and plead with the father for the welfare
of his children.
Land Inheritance
After the death of the father the land passed on to
his sons, the eldest son took his father's place. At this
juncture the system of land tenure changed a little, there
was no one who could regard the land as "mine," all
would call it " our land." The eldest son who had assumed
the title of moramatl (titular or trustee) had no more rights
than his brothers, except the title; he could not sell the
land without the agreement of his brothers who had the
same full cultivation rights on the pieces of land which
they cultivated as well as those which were cultivated by
their respective mothers.
At this stage the land had now become family or mbari
land, under the name of the original owner (Mogori
Githaka or Mwene Githaka). For instance, if the original
owner was Kamau, his mbari would be known as mbari ya
Kamau (the Kamau's family group), and the land as ng'undu
or githaka kia mbari ya Kamau, i.e. the land of Kamau's
family group. Through this process the land passed from
one man to his sons and then it was actually vested in the
clan's name.
The above statement shows clearly that the Gikuyu
system of land tenure was never tribal tenure, nor was there
any customary law which gave any particular chief or a
group of chiefs any power over lands other than the lands
of their own family groups.
A chief could only give
cultivation or building rights to a mohoi or mothami on his
own land or that of his mbari, but in this case he could do
so only if he was a moramatl. Otherwise he had no power

Land Tenure

33

to give or sell land outside the boundary of his own personal
property.
The policy of making a chief a trustee or investing him
with the power of allotting" tribal or communal lands,"
is entirely new and foreign to the Gikuyu democratic
principles. The power to decide land disputes was invested
in the councils of elders (kiama), who conducted all land
transactions. Any chief who participated in these councils
did so in his capacity of an elder (mothuuri wa kiama),
and not as a chief.
Up to this point we have been following the Gikuyu
system of land tenure, from the founder of the tribe to the
Gumba and Ndorobo, the master of the forests; and then
to the first purchaser and his family. We have now reached
the juncture where the administration of the land has passed
to the moramati. Having done so, it is necessary to add a
short description of the moramatl and his duty to his
brothers on whose behalf he acts as a trustee.
Moramati owes his position to his seniority in age, and
to being the first son of the first wife. And in a case where
the first wife had no sons, the first son of the second wife
became the heir. The duty of the moramatl was to see that
the land was properly used, and to carry out the wishes of
his dead father. Moramati had no more cultivation or
building rights than his brothers.
Agriculturally he was
only the ceremonial figurehead and master of his own pieces
of cultivated fields in the same way as his father's wives,
brothers and sisters. If any of them wanted to clear a piece
of virgin land, he or she was at liberty to do so, providing
that there was no taboo or custom prohibiting cultivation
of that particular piece of land.
If an outsider wanted to acquire cultivation or building
rights, as a mohoi or mothaml, such rights could only be

34

Facing Mount Kenya

given by the moramatl with the consent of other members
of the family group. In the first place the moramatl, before
giving such rights, would see to it that there was enough
land for the needs of his group. Secondly, he would
not grant cultivation rights on the fallow land that had
previously been cultivated by any of his juniors, unless
they had abandoned the cultivation of such a land
altogether.
Before a man was given cultivation or building rights
his character and past history were carefully scrutinised to
make sure that he was not a trouble-maker. A mohoi or
mothami was given permission to settle on the land only
on the understanding that he would respect the rights of
the members of the landowning family and keep peace with
them. As a sign of his adherence to this agreement he had
to give a calabash or gourd of beer to the moramatl or his
representative, whenever he had an occasion of brewing
beer. This obligation was strictly applied to a man who
had been given cultivation and building rights (mothami),
but if he had only cultivation rights (mohoi), his obligation
to give beer was only when he had brewed sugar-cane beer
from the land given to him.
A mothami was further obliged to help in case of any
work of emergency such as building houses or cattle-pens.
If a mothami behaved decently his family and that of the
landowner sometimes joined in teamwork for mutual
benefits. On the other hand, a breach of the contract on
the part of a mothami meant withdrawal of his rights and
removal from the land. The authority to carry this out
was invested in the hands of the moramati. If a mothami
or mohoi refused to quit the land, he was taken before
the Iciama (council of elders), who naturally gave judgment
in favour of the morarna ti. But in any case a mohoi or

Land Tenure

35

mothami was given sufficient notice to find another land
and also to harvest his crops. Apart from the beer which
was given. as a token of friendship and respect, there was no
payment of rent of any kind for the use of the land. The
cultivation or building rights were given purely as a matter
of friendship and not on a business basis.
There was another situation necessitating a change in
the position of the moramatl ; for instance, if he mismanaged
the land and a quarrel arose between him and his juniors, the
village council (!r.:.iamagia itora) was summoned to divide
up the land equally among the male representatives of the
family group. But this was only done when all effort to
seek conciliation had failed. When the land was divided
up, the moramati was left to himself and his own immediate
family, i.e, his wife or wives and their children. The rest,
if they wanted to continue the management of their land
under one head, appointed one of themselves as the new
moramati and carried on with their affairs as before.
When the land was thus divided up, the old moramati
could sell his own portion to anybody else, and perhaps
move away and buy land in another district. According to the customary law of land tenure, if one of the
brothers wanted to sell out his share, the relatives had the
first option so as to avoid a stranger coming in their midst.
The one whose right was bought out, and his descendants,
lost all claims to the original ancestral land, and were
treated as mere strangers.
Before the sanction for the sale of such land was given,
the matter was carefully scrutinised by the kiama in order
to preserve kinship unity in connection with the ancestral
land. For the selling out of his rights in the family land
was the last thing that a man could do to sever the relation
with his kinsfolk. In perpetuation of the kinship unity it

Facing Mount Kenya
was considered right and proper for a. man to reserve his
rights in the ancestral land, so that if misfortune should
befall him in his ventures, he could always return to his
ancestral home and be received with joy by his kinsfolk.

Pasture Land and Public Places
It is important to mention that in every district there were
pasture lands where livestock grazed in common. There
were also salt-licks (moonyo) and mineral springs (irori),
the access to which was free to all those in the district. In
addition to these there were public places (inaaro) reserved
for meetings and dances. And also public roads and paths
(njera cia agendi), as well as sacred groves where national
sacrifices were offered to Ngai.
Public opinion entered strongly in the management of
the above-mentioned lands, for although in reality these
lands were owned by different individual families, in actual
uses they were treated as common lands. Whenever a
salt-lick or a mineral spring was found on any land, whether
cultivated or uncultivated, the owner could not prevent
other people in the district from sending their livestock to
such places. But in the case of a poor man who had no
other land, he was given another piece of land by the elders
of the district. But for pasture lands there were permanent
grass or bush lands reserved for that purpose. Generally
these lands were situated some distance from the homesteads, some of them were considered not good for cultivation except along the rivers where sugar-cane, bananas, and
ndoma (arum lily) were cultivated.
Near homesteads there were also pasture lands, owing
to the system of cultivating the lands in rotation, and
besides this there was also woodland, reserved for building

Land Tenure

37

materials and firewood. The use of such land for grazing
was restricted to the family group possessing it. They
could give or withhold the permission to outsiders.
If we consider for a moment the pasture lands, salt-licks,
public meeting and dance places, the woodlands, including
big forests along the frontier of the Gikuyu and the neighbouring tribes, we will at once see that there were big tracts
of lands used for other purposes than cultivation and which
was equally important to the community.
It is of these lands that the early European travellers
reported that they had seen huge lands "undeveloped"
and" unoccupied."
To them it may have seemed so, but
to the Gikuyu every inch of their territory was useful in
some way or another. To a Gikuyu these lands were no
more unoccupied than moorlands in England, for if a
Gikuyu was asked to make a report on such moorlands,
he would naturally report that these lands are undeveloped
and unoccupied. The mere absence of large herds of sheep
and goats on the lands, and the lack of bananas, yams and
sugar-cane cultivation would be sufficient evidence to convince him that those lands were not put to " proper uses."
Just in the same way the Europeans did not justify the
usefulness of bush land in Africa where they expected to
find cultivated grass-land for pasture.

Ceremony of Marking the Boundary
In analysing the Gikuyu system of land tenure the most
important aspect and deciding factor as to the ownership
of land is the ceremony of marking the boundary.
This
was performed only when absolute land sale took place.
In the case of a mohoi or mothami, mociarwa or mothoni, no
such ceremony could be performed between them and the
E

Facing Mount Kenya
landlord, for they had only been given cultivation or
building rights.
It was only when the purchaser had paid or agreed to pay
the number of sheep and goats required as the price of the
land, that the two parties concluded an agreement in the form
of a ceremony. This was done in the presence of the principal
elders of the district who acted as witnesses. Before buying
and selling of land took place, there was a preliminary
ceremonial discussion between the seller and the buyer.
According to the etiquette of the people, no man could go
directly to another and tell him that he wanted to buy his
land. The same applied to the seller, he could not advertise
the sale of his land publicly; the reason being that the land
was regarded as the mother of the people, and as such the
selling or buying of it must be treated matrimonially.
Therefore, the correct approach was that when a man
wanted to buy another man's land, he would brew a small
beer and take it to the landowner in the same way as if he
was proposing marriage to his daughter. After sipping the
beer ceremonially, the two men would then join in a conversation, talking in parable something like this: " Well,
son of So-and-So, I brought you this small beer to tell
you that within your homestead I have seen a beautiful
lass. I hope you will excuse me when I say that I am madly
in love with her. My great desire which urged me to come
here to-day is to ask you if you will accept me as your
son-in-law.
I am sure that you, being a man of great
experience, will not fail to see the admiration I have in my
heart for your beautiful lass. And I know that you will
not fail to give your consent to my humble request."
Through such a conversation the landowner would know
at once what his guest really wanted. Then, in the same
parable language, they would agree or disagree. If they

Land Tenure

39

agreed about the price of the land they would fix a date and
invite the elders of the district to be present as ceremonial
witnesses.
On the day appointed, the elders gathered on the iand in
question, where the two parties wishing to enter into
symbolical matrimony awaited them. The seller of the
land was asked to testify by an oath that the land he was
selling was his own property, that he or his ancestors were
the original and rightful owners. And that he was satisfied
with the number of sheep and goats he had asked as the
price of his land, and that later he would not ask the
purchaser to give him more than what had been already
agreed to. Then the elders turned to the purchaser and
asked him to take oath and declare that he had willingly
agreed to buy the land and to give the number of sheep
and goats asked for it. And that the animals he was giving
were his own or family property, that there was no dispute
as to the ownership of such property in his family group or
outside it.
When the above declaration was concluded, the purchaser
provided a ram, which was slaughtered on the spot where the
declaration was made. The contents of the stomach were
taken out, then the elders formed a procession with the
seller and the purchaser at the head of it. They moved
slowly chanting a ceremonial melody connected with the
fertility of the soil. The landowner pointed out the boundary of his land which he was selling, at the same time the
ceremonial elder sprinkled the contents of the stomach
along the line, while the rest planted trees and lilies (matooka)
as a permanent boundary mark.
The elders, in their ritual tones, uttered curses against
anyone who should cunningly or maliciously remove the
boundary mark of his neighbour.
When the marking of

Facing Mount Kenya
the boundary was completed, all sat down at the centre of the
land, two small pieces were cut from the skin of the ram,
the purchaser put one on his right wrist and as did the
seller. This act of uniting the two men in the land transaction, who now regarded one another as relatives-in-law,
concluded the ceremony of marking the boundary.
After the elders had finished their official duty they
joined in a meat feast and sometimes in beer drinking.
The elder who sprinkled the contents of the stomach along
the boundary line was given a ewe as the reward for his
laborious duty. The official name of the ritual gift is known
as " mwate wa kuhura njegeni," i.e. a ewe for dusting off
aching caused by a stinging creeper called njegeni.
According to the Gikuyu system of land tenure no man
could claim absolute ownership of any land unless he or his
ancestors have gone through the ceremony of marking the
boundary, which was the Gikuyu form of title-deed. The
boundary trees and lilies so ceremonially planted were
highly respected by the people. They were well looked
after and preserved.
The history connected with such
lands was passed from one generation to another. No man
dared to remove his neighbour's boundary mark, for fear
of his neighbour's curses and out of respect for him.
If one of the boundary trees or lilies dried out, fell
down, or was rooted up by the wild animals, the two
neighbours would visit the spot and perhaps replace it,
but if they could not agree as to the actual place where the
mark stood, they called one or two elders who, with a
little ceremony, replanted the tree or lilies. But in a case.of
a big dispute, especially where a fire had destroyed boundary
marks, a full council of elders was called to replant the
tree and lilies.

Land Tenure
Land Tenure and the Coming of tile Europeans
In the foregoing analysis we have traced how the land
was formerly acquired and how the rules governing the
system of land tenure were laid down. Further, we have
shown the relations between the landowner and his
immediate family, and the relations between that group
and those who acquired cultivation or building rights.
Later on we will show how this generosity of giving
temporary cultivation or building rights to strangers was
extended to the Europeans when they arrived in the
Gikuyu land. Before entering into this discussion it is
necessary first to give a short account of the prophecy of a
great Gikuyu medicine man, Mogo wa Kebiro, who predicted the coming of the Europeans and the result thereof.

Mogo wa Kebiro and his Prediction
Once upon a time there lived in Gikuyuland a great
medicine man known as Mogo or Mora wa Kebiro, his
national duty was to foretell future events and to advise
the nation how to prepare for what was in store. We are
told that one early morning the prophet woke up trembling
and unable to speak, his body was covered with bruises.
His wives on seeing him were very frightened and in a
state of hysteria, not knowing what had happened to their
husband, who went to bed in perfect health the previous
evening.
Horror-stricken,
the family summoned the
ceremonial elders to his side with a view to offer a sacrifice
to Ngai (God) and to inquire what the great man had
foreseen that had so frightened him.
When the ceremonial elders arrived, a male goat
(thenge) was immediately slaughtered and Mogo wa Kebiro

Facing Mount Kenya
was seated on the raw skin. The senior elder among the
gathering took the blood of the animal, mixed it with oil,
and then this mixture was poured on the head of the great
seer as an anointment.
At the same time the ceremonial
elders, saturated with religious beliefs, recited ritual songs
as supplication to Ngai. Soon Mogo wa Kebiro regained
his power of speech. With his usual prophetic voice he
began to narrate what he had experienced during the
previous night. He told the elders that during his sleep
Ngai (God) had taken him away to an unknown land. There
the Ngai had revealed to him what would happen to the
Gikuyu people in the near future. On hearing this he was
horrified, and in his endeavour to persuade Ngai to avert
the evil events coming to the Gikuyu, he was badly bruised
and exhausted and could not do anything but obey the
Ngai's command to come back and tell the people what
would happen.
After a little pause, Mogo wa Kebiro continued his
prophetic narrative. In a low and sad voice he said that
strangers would come to Gikuyuland from out of the big
water, the colour of their body would resemble that of a
small light-coloured frog (kiengere) which lives in water,
their dress would resemble the wings of butterflies; that
these strangers would carry magical sticks which would
produce fire. That these sticks would be very much worse
in killing than the poisoned arrows. The strangers, he said,
would later bring an iron snake with as many legs as
monyongoro (centipede), that this iron snake would spit
fires and would stretch from the big water in the east to
another big water in the west of the Gikuyu country.
Further, he said that a big famine would come and this
would be the sign to show that the strangers with their iron
snake were near at hand. He went on to say that when this

Land Tenure

43

came to pass the Gikuyu, as well as their neighbours, would
suffer greatly.
That the nations would mingle with a
merciless attitude towards each other, and the result would
seem as though they were eating one another. He also
said that sons and daughters would abuse their parents in a
way unknown hitherto by the Gikuyu.
Mogo wa Kebiro urged the people not to take arms
against the coming strangers, that the result of such actions
would be annihilation of the tribe, because the strangers
would be able to kill the people from a far distance with
their magical sticks which spit deadly fires. The warriors
were very angry when they heard this statement and said
that they would take up arms and kill the iron snake and
the strangers. But the great seer calmed them and told the
warriors that the best thing would be to establish friendly
relation with the coming strangers, because the spears and
arrows would not be able to penetrate the iron snake, and
therefore the warrior's attempt to fight the strangers
and their snake would be futile.
The great medicine man advised the people that when
these strangers arrived it would be the best policy to treat
them with courtesy mingled with suspicion, anrl above all
to be careful not to bring them too close to their homesteads,
for these strangers are full of evil deeds and would not
hesitate to covet the Gikuyu homeland and in the end would
want to take everything from the Gikuyu.
When the people heard what Mogo wa Kebiro had
predicted they were very disturbed and did 110tknow what
to do except wait and face the coming danger. Many
moons afterwards, about 1890 or thereabout, the predicted
danger began to appear, for sure enough, the strangers
dressed in clothes resembling the wings of butterflies
started to arrive in small groups;
this was expected, for

44

Facing Mount Kenya

prior to their arrival a terrible disease called ndigana or
nyongo, had broken out and destroyed a great number of
Gikuyu cattle as well as those of the neighbouring tribes,
the Masai and Wakamba. The incident was followed by a
great famine, which also devastated thousands of the
tribesmen.
The first few Europeans who passed near the Gikuyu
country were more or less harmless, for they passed through
along the borderline of the country between the Gikuyu
and Masai or between Wakamba and the Gikuyu. They
were thus directed according to the prediction of the great
medicine man. The Europeans with their caravans kept
coming and going the same way from the coast to Lake
Victoria and Uganda. In their upwards and downwards
journeys they traded with the Gikuyu with little or no
conflict. At last, misled by European cant, the Gikuyu
thought that the Europeans with their caravans did not
mean any harm and befriended them. Forgetting the
words of Mogo wa Kebiro to treat the Europeans with
courtesy mingled with suspicion and not to bring themnear their homesteads, the Gikuyu began to welcome the
Europeans in close proximity to their homesteads.
At this stage it is interesting to gave a short narrative
of how the Gikuyu came to lose their best lands. When
the Europeans first came into the Gikuyuland the Gikuyu
looked upon them as wanderers (orori or athongo) who had
deserted from their homes and were lonely and in need of
friends.
The Gikuyu, in their natural generosity and
hospitality, welcomed the wanderers and felt pity for them.
As such the Europeans were allowed to pitch their tents
and to have a temporary right of occupation on the land
in the same category as those Gikuyu mohoi or mothaml
who are given only cultivation or building rights. The

Land Tenure

45

Europeans were treated in this way in the belief that one
day they would get tired of wandering and finally return to
their own country.
These early Empire builders, knowing what they were
after, played on the ignorance and sincere hospitable nature
of the people. They agreed to the terms of a mohoi or
mothami, and soon started to build small forts or camps,
saying that" the object of a station is to form a centre for
the purchase of food for caravans proceeding to Uganda,"
etc. For" Kikuyu was reported a country where food
was extraordinarily abundant and cheap,"!
The Gikuyu gave the Europeans building rights in
places like Dagoretti, Fort Smith and others, with no
idea of the motives which were behind the caravans, for
they thought that it was only a matter of trading and
nothing else. Unfortunately, they did not realise that these
places were used for the preliminary preparations for
taking away their land from them. They established friendly
relations with the Europeans and supplied them with food
for their caravans, taking it for granted that naturally the
white wanderers must undoubtedly have their own country,
and therefore could not settle for good in a foreign land,
that they would feel home-sick and, after selling their
goods, would go back to live in their homesteads with
parents and relatives.
The belief that the Europeans were not going to live
permanently in Africa, was strengthened by the fact that
none of them seemed to stay very long in one place. Therefore, reasoning from this, the Gikuyu naturally came to the
conclusion that one day all the Europeans in Africa would
pack up bag and baggage and return to their own country

friendship with the strangers, was afterwards deported and
died on his way to the coast. People were indignant for
these acts of ingratitude on the part of the Europeans, and
declined to trade with them, thinking that the Europeans
and their caravans would get hungry and move away from
the Gikuyu country ; but soon the Gikuyu were made to
know that" might is right," for it is reported that" from
this country of teeming abundance, where in a few days I
obtained many thousand pounds of food, the officer finds
it impossible to purchase a single bag of grain," and parties
were sent out regularly to take it by force I-and " large
armed parties were necessary to procure firewood and
water."!
The prediction of Mogo wa Kebiro was slowly being
fulfilled, for soon afterwards the Kenya-Uganda railway
(the iron snake) was completed.
And the Europeans,
having their feet firm on the soil, began to claim the
absolute right to rule the country and to have the ownership
of the lands under the title of" Crown Lands," where the
Gikuyu, who are the original owners, now live as " tenants
at will of the Crown."
The Gikuyu lost most of their
lands through their magnanimity, for the Gikuyu country
was never wholly conquered by force of arms, but the
people were put under the ruthless domination of European
imperialism through the insidious trickery of hypocritical
treaties.
The relation between the Gikuyu and the Europeans can
well be illustrated by a Gikuyu story which says: That
once upon a time an elephant made a friendship with a
man. One day a heavy thunderstorm broke out, the
elephant went to his friend, who had a little hut at the edge
of the forest, and said to him: "My dear good man, will
1

in the same way as they came. It was a common saying
among the Gikuyu until a few years ago that" Gotire ondo
wa ndereri, nagowo Coomba no okainoka;" which means:
That there is no mortal thing or act that lives for eternity,
the Europeans will, no doubt, eventually go back to their
own country. This saying was taken up as a lamenting
slogan, and was sung in various songs, especially when the
wanderers started to show their real motive for wandering.
The early travellers reported that" Kikuyu promised to
be the most progressive station between the coast and the
lake. The natives were very friendly, and even enlisted as
porters to go to the coast, but these good relations received
a disastrous check. Owing largely to the want of discipline
in the passing caravans, whose men robbed the crops and
otherwise made themselves troublesome, the people became
estranged, and presently murdered several porters."! This
was the beginning of the suffering and the use of the sticks
which produced killing fire, as Mogo wa Kebiro had predicted in his prophecy of the coming of the white men.
For soon after the above incident, we are told that the
Gikuyu were "taught a lesson," they were compelled
to make " the payment of fifty goats daily, and the free
work of three hundred men to build the fort they had
destroyed. "2
After this event the Gikuyu, with bitterness in their
hearts, realised that the strangers they had given hospitality
to had planned to plunder and subjugate them by brute
force. The chief, Waiyaki,3 who had entered into a treaty of

friendship with the strangers, was afterwards deported and
died on his way to the coast. People were indignant for
these acts of ingratitude on the part of the Europeans, and
declined to trade with them, thinking that the Europeans
and their caravans would get hungry and move away from

know that" might is right," for it is reported that" from

The prediction of Mogo wa Kebiro was slowly being
fulfilled, for soon afterwards the Kenya-Uganda railway
(the iron snake) was completed.
And the Europeans,
having their feet firm on the soil, began to claim the
absolute right to rule the country and to have the ownership
of the lands under the title of " Crown Lands," where the
Gikuyu, who are the original owners, now live as " tenants

The Gikuyu lost most of their
lands through their magnanimity, for the Gikuyu country
was never wholly conquered by force of arms, but the
people were put under the ruthless domination of European
imperialism through the insidious trickery of hypocritical
treaties.
The relation between the Gikuyu and the Europeans can
well be illustrated by a Gikuyu story which says: That
once upon a time an elephant made a friendship with a
man. One day a heavy thunderstorm broke out, the
elephant went to his friend, who had a little hut at the edge
of the forest, and said to him: "My dear good man, will
1

Blue-BooK Africa, No.8,

Facing Mount Kenya
you please let me put my trunk inside your hut to keep ~t
out of this torrential rain?"
The man, seeing what
situation his friend was in, replied: "My dear good
elephant, my hut is very small, but there is room for your
trunk and myself. please put your trunk in gently." The
elephant thanked his friend, saying: "You have done me
a good deed and one day I shall return your kindness."
But what followed? As soon as the elephant put his trunk
inside the hut, slowly he pushed his head inside, and finally
flung the man out in the rain, and then lay down comfortably
inside his friend's hut, saying: "My dear good friend, your
skin is harder than mine, and as there is not enough room
for both of us, you can afford to remain in the rain
while I am protecting my delicate skin from the hailstorm."
The man, seeing what his friend had done to him, started
to grumble, the animals in the nearby forest heard the noise
and came to see what was the matter. All stood around
listening to the heated argument between the man and his
friend the elephant. In this turmoil the lion came along
roaring, and said in a loud voice: "Don't you all know
that I am the King of the Jungle! How dare anyone disturb
the peace of my kingdom?" On hearing this the elephant,
who was one of the high ministers in the jungle kingdom,
replied in a soothing voice, and said: .. My Lord, there is
no disturbance of the peace in your kingdom. I have
only been having a little discussion with my friend here as
to the possession of this little hut which your lordship sees
me occupying." The lion, who wanted to have" peace
and tranquillity" in his kingdom, replied in a noble voice,
saying: "I command my ministers to appoint a Commission of Enquiry to go thoroughly into this matter and
report accordingly." He then turned to the man and said:

Land Tenure

49

" You have done well by establishing friendship with my
people, especially with the elephant who is one of my
honourable ministers of state. Do not grumble any more,
your hut is not lost to you. Wait until the sitting of my
Imperial Commission, and there you will be given plenty
of opportunity to state your case. I am sure that you will
be pleased with the findings of the Commission."
The
man was very pleased by these sweet words from the King
of the Jungle, and innocently waited for his opportunity,
in the belief, that naturally, the hut would be returned to
him.
The elephant, obeying the command of his master, got
busy with other ministers to appoint the Commission of
Enquiry. The following elders of the jungle were appointed
to sit in the Commission: (I) Mr. Rhinoceros; (2) Mr.
Buffalo; (3) Mr. Alligator; (4) The Rt. Hon. Mr. Fox
to act as chairman; and (5) Mr. Leopard to act as Secretary
to the Commission.
On seeing the personnel, the man
protested and asked if it was not necessary to include in this
Commission a member from his side. But he was told that
it was impossible, since no one from his side was well
enough educated to understand the intricacy of jungle law.
Further, that there was nothing to fear, for the members of
the Commission were all men of repute for their impartiality
in justice, and as they were gentlemen chosen by God to
look after the interests of races less adequately endowed with
teeth and claws, he might rest assured that they would
investigate the matter with the greatest care and report
impartially.
The Commission sat to take the evidence. The Rt. Hon.
Mr. Elephant was first called. He came along with a
superior air, brushing his tusks with a sapling which Mrs.
Elephant had provided, and in an authoritative voice said:

Facing Mount Kenya
" Gentlemen of the Jungle, there is no need for me to waste
your valuable time in relating a story which I am sure you
all know. I have always regarded it as my duty to protect
the interests of my friends, and this appears to have caused
the misunderstanding between myself and my friend here.
He invited me to save his hut from being blown away by a
hurricane. As the hurricane had gained access owing to the
unoccupied space in the hut, I considered it necessary, in
my friend's own interests, to turn the undeveloped space to
a more economic use by sitting in it myself; a duty which
any of you would undoubtedly have performed with equal
readiness in similar circumstances."
After hearing the Rt. Han. Mr. Elephant's conclusive
evidence, the Commission called Mr. Hyena and other
elders of the jungle, who all supported what Mr. Elephant
had said. They then called the man, who began to give his
own account of the dispute. But the Commission cut him
short, saying: "My good man, please confine yourself to
relevant issues. We have already heard the circumstances
from various unbiased sources; all we wish you to tell us
is whether the undeveloped space in your hut was occupied
by anyone else before Mr. Elephant assumed his position? "
The man began to say: "No, but--"
But at this
point the Commission declared that they had heard sufficient
evidence from both sides and retired to consider their
decision. After enjoying a delicious meal at the expense of
the Rt. Hon. Mr. Elephant, they reached their verdict,
called the man, and declared as follows: "In our opinion
this dispute has arisen through a regrettable misunderstanding due to the backwardness of your ideas. We
consider that Mr. Elephant has fulfilled his sacred duty of
protecting your interests. As it is clearly for your good
that the space should be put to ftts most economic use, and

Land Tenure
as you yourself have not yet reached the stage of expansion
which would enable you to fill it, we consider it necessary to
arrange a compromise to suit both parties. Mr. Elephant
shall continue his occupation of your hut, but we give you
permission to look for a site where you can build another
hut more suited to your needs, and we will see that you are
well protected."
The man, having no alternative, and fearing that his
refusal might expose him to the teeth and claws of members
of the Commission, did as they suggested. But no sooner
had he built another hut than Mr. Rhinoceros charged in
with his horn lowered and ordered the man to quit. A
Royal Commission was again appointed to look into the
matter, and the same finding was given. This procedure
was repeated until Mr. Buffalo, Mr. Leopard, Mr. Hyena
and the rest were all accommodated with new huts. Then
the man decided that he must adopt an effective method of
protection, since Commissions of Enquiry did not seem to
be of any use to him. He sat down and said: " Ng' enda thi
ndeagaga motegi," which literally means" there is nothing
that treads on the earth that cannot be trapped," or in
other words, you can fool people for a time, but not for
ever.
Early one morning, when the huts already occupied by
the jungle lords were all beginning to decay and fall to
pieces, he went out and built a bigger and better hut a
little distance away. No sooner had Mr. Rhinoceros seen
it than he came rushing in, only to find that Mr. Elephant
was already inside, sound asleep. Mr. Leopard next came
in at the window, Mr. Lion, Mr. Fox, and Mr. Buffalo
entered the doors, while Mr. Hyena howled for a place in
the shade and Mr. Alligator basked on the roof. Presently
they all began disputing about their rights of penetration,

Facing Mount Kenya
and from disputing they came to fighting, and while they
were all embroiled together the man set the hut on fire and
burnt it to the ground, jungle lords and all. Then he went
home, saying: "Peace is costly, but it's worth the expense,"
and lived happily ever after.

CHAPTER III

Economic Life
Division of Labour
Nthe previous chapter we have been discussing the
land tenure, which is the most important factor, as
we shall see presently, in our analysis of the economic
life of the Gikuyu, for the supply of material needs depends
entirely on the land.
The chief occupations among the Gikuyu are agriculture
and the rearing of livestock, such as cattle, sheep and goats.
Each family, i.e. a man, his wife or wives and their children,
constitute an economic unit.
This is controlled and
strengthened by the system of division of labour according
to sex. From the homestead to the fields and to the tending
of the domestic animals, every sphere of activity is clearly
and systematically defined. Each member of the family
unit knows perfectly well what task he or she is required
to perform, in their economic productivity and distribution
of the family resources, so as to ensure the material prosperity of the group.
The best point for starting our analysis of the division
of labour is from the homestead and then moving gradually
to the fields. In house-building the heavy work of cutting
limbers and putting up the framework falls on men.

I

53

54

Facing Mount Kenya

Carrying and cutting of the grass for thatching and plastering the wall with clay or cow-dung is the work of women.
Men build fences around the homestead or gardens and
also cattle-pens. They are the night watchmen to protect
the crops against the wild animals.
The entire housework naturally falls within the sphere
of women's activities. They cook, bring water from the
rivers, wash utensils and fetch firewood from the forests or
bush. They also perform the task of carrying the loads
on their backs. According to the tribal customs which
govern the division of labour, no man would dare to indulge
in any of these activities except in a case of emergency, or
otherwise he would scandalise the women and it would be
difficult for such a man to get any girl to marry him. He
would be given a nickname, Icihongoyo or moburabureki,
something like" Nosy Parker."
Women are afraid of a
man of this character, for they say that if he could perform
women's work, what is the use of getting married, for how
can a wife and husband be doing the same thing at the same

time?
In cultivating the fields men clear the bush and cut big
trees, and also break the virgin soil with digging-sticks or
hoes. Women come behind them and prepare the ground
for sowing seeds. Planting is shared by both sexes. Men
plant bananas, yams, sweet potato vines, sugar-canes,
tobacco, and also provide poles for propping up bananas and
yams. W omen plant maize, various kinds of beans, millet
and sweet potato vines.
Weeding is done collectively. Cutting drains or waterfurrows and pruning of banana plants, as well as making
roads and bridges, is the work of men. Harvesting is done
chiefly by the women. Tending of cattle, sheep and goats,
and also slaughtering and distributing the meat and prepar-

Economic Life
ing the skins, is entirely the men's duty. Dress-making,
pottery and weaving of baskets is exclusively women's
profession.
Wood-carving,
smith's work, bee-keeping
and hunting are men's occupations. Women take responsibility for grinding corn and millet, for making gruel, and
pounding grains in wooden mortars.
They also pound
sugar-canes for making beer.
The brewing of beer is done jointly by both men and
women. Men cut the canes from the field and peal them,
and the women carry the canes home. While the women
are pounding, the men are busy mixing the substance of the
sugar-canes with the water and squeezing or wringing the
juice out of it, and also straining the juice into fermenting
gourds. Trading is done by both sexes. Carrying and
seIling grains at the markets is chiefly done by women,
while taking sheep and goats or cattle to the markets and
seIling them is the job of men.

Agriculture
The land being the foundation rock on which the Gikuyu
tribal economy stands, and the only effective mode of production that the people have, the result is that there is a
great desire in the heart of every Gikuyu man to own a
piece of land on which he can build his home, and from
which he and his family can get the means of livelihood.
A man or a woman who cannot say to his friends, come and
eat, drink and enjoy the fruit of my labour, is not considered
as a worthy member of the tribe.
A family group with land to cultivate is considered as a
self-supporting economic unit. The group work harmoniously with a view to satisfying their immediate needs, and
with the desire to accumulate wealth in the form of cattle,

F acing M.aunt Kenya
sheep and goats. These are acquired through effective
tillage of the land, except in a very few cases nowadays
where some people are able to get money in some other
ways than selling their products.

Children in Economic Activities
Children begin their activities in production when they
are young as a part of their training in agriculture and
herding. When children are very young they are left at
home minding small babies, or are taken by their parents
to the field where they are allowed to play in a corner of the
cultivated field. Soon the children get interested in the
work and are ambitious to participate in gardening. As
soon as they are able to handle a digging-stick they are
given small allotments to practice on.
The children are very proud of their small gardens and
take great interest in learning how to become good agriculturalists.
Parents help them to plant seeds and teach
them how to distinguish the crops from the wild plants or
weeds.
For sometimes children keep on rooting out
growing crops together with weeds, until gradually their
eyes get to recognise what are weeds and what are crops.
The children are very enthusiastic in their work, and
frequently like to take their playmates and proudly show
them round the small gardens, saying: "Look how our
crops are growing niceiy, surely we are going to have a
good harvest, and then we can have a big feast as a result
of our labour."
As a child grows, its sphere of activities in gardening
increases. Instead of small fields, a large one is provided
according to the capability of the child. Of course, the
work is done collectively. The crops thus cultivated are

Economic Life
in the care of the mother, who is the managing director of
food supply in the homestead.
The children co-operate with their parents in production
and distribution of the family's resources and wealth until
the time of marriage. When a girl marries, if her husband's
homestead is near, she continues to cultivate her childhood
gardens and takes the crops home for the use of herself and
her husband. On the other hand, if she goes far away to
live, she leaves the gardens to her mother. In the case of a
boy, he takes full control of his gardens when he marries. For
although he still co-operates with his parents in the general
economy of the family group, he and his wife are now
responsible for supplying and satisfying their own immediate
material needs.
Seasonal Calendar

In the Gikuyu country there are four seasons and two
harvests in one year. These are divided as follows: (I) The
season of big rain (mburaya njahe) from March to July; (2)
the season of big harvest (magetha ma njahe), between July
and early October; (3) short rain season (mburaya mwere),
from October to January;
(4) the season of harvesting
millet (magetha ma mwere), from January to March. There
are various names attached to these seasons, according to
the activities pursued during each season, such as clearing
virgin land (matuguta), protecting millet from the birds
(marira ma mwere), etc., but the names mentioned above
are the main division of the seasonal calendar.

Preparing Fields for Planting
Where land is available the system of cultivating it in
rotation is the most favoured, for it gives a farmer or

Facing Mount Kenya
peasant an opportunity of getting a new field every four or
five seasons, and at the same time letting the old one rest
fallow. In this way a peasant is able to get good crops
without using manure, because most of the Gikuyu land is
very fertile. In cases where land is not available, especially
nowadays owing to the alienation of the Gikuyu lands,
people depend entirely on turning their land over and over
again to renew it.
During the hot season a family group gets together and
prepares their fields ready for planting. Every member of
the group has his or her own fields for various seasonal
crops, such as maize, a variety of beans, sweet potatoes and
European potatoes and other vegetables. All these are
planted at once when the rain starts. They are the mainstay
of the Gikuyu diet.
Permanent crops such as yams, sugar-canes, bananas, can
only flourish in particular soils in various localities. The
planting of these is a matter for individuals and for the
custom of different districts. These are not crops that
everyone in the community can afford to grow on account
of the suitable soil and water they require. In some districts,
especially Fort Hall and Nyeri, these articles of food are
plentiful, but in other districts they are looked on as
somewhat of a luxury.
It would be tedious to describe here planting ceremonies
or magic connected with the economic activities in the fields,
as the magic which enters into the economic life of the
people is dealt with in Chapter X on religion and ancestor
worship.
To avoid repetition of magical aspects we will proceed
to analyse the work and crops in the fields. Apart from
the crops mentioned above, there are three kinds of crops
which are planted in rotation, namely, millet (mwere), tree

Economic Life

59

peas (njogo), and njahe, a very nourishing kind of beans used
mostly to feed women after child-birth.
Njogo and njahe
are planted during the big rain season, and mwere during
the short rain season. The reason being that if njahe and
njogo are planted during the short rain season, the result
will be failure, because they are very slow-growing crops
and need plenty of water. The same with mwere , if it is
planted during the big rain, it will grow taller and taller,
and bear very little or no grain at all. From a scientific
and economic point of view, obtained from years of
trial and error, the planting of crops and weeding of the
gardens are done according to the seasonal calendar.

Clearing Weeds
When crops are about four or five inches high the weeding
of the ground is started. During this time people join in a
collective weeding. Four or five persons or more form a
group for team-work, they cultivate one man's field one
day then next day another man's field, and so on until they
clear weeds from all their fields. Another way of cultivating
the fields is by inviting a group of friends, ten or more,
and providing them with a feast of beer or gruel and other
edibles. This is not looked upon as a reward for the work
done, but as hospitality to one's guests.
After a man has informed his friends about the work he
wants them to help in, a day is fixed, generally three days
ahead. On the day appointed, the friends meet in the
garden or field early in the morning and start to work
enthusiastically, singing cultivation songs, sometimes they
will challenge cultivators in the next field and compete
with them in work and songs. About midday, when the
sun becomes hot, they have finished clearing a big field.

60

Facing Mount Kenya

At this juncture they retire and start feasting joyously for
having completed the work of helping their friend.
If a stranger happens to pass by at this time of enjoyment
after labour he will have no idea that these people who are
now singing, dancing and laughing merrily, have completed their day's work. For after they have cleaned off the
dust which they got from the fields, they look, in all
respects, as though they have been enjoying themselves the
whole day. This is why most of the Europeans have erred
by making general remarks that "the African is a lazy
being and likes to bask in the sun, while his wife or wives
work for him," not realising that the African in his own
environment does not count hours or work by the movement of the clock, but works with good spirit and
enthusiasm to complete the task before him. In this wayan
African is able to work better and quicker in his own field,
where he is his own master, than when employed by the
Europeans where he has to be bossed about.
To turn to our analysis of the work in the fields, the
correct method of ensuring a good crop is, that while the
crops are growing the fields are weeded over and over again
until there are no more weeds growing [here. Then comes
a time of relaxation waiting for the harvest. This is a
period of numerous dances and songs and performing
various ceremonies, especially if a good harvest is expected.
About this time one of the quick-growing kind of bean
(mhoco) is ripe, and is taken as a supplement to food
prepared from the grains stored during the previous harvest.

Marketing
At this time people have finished the heavy work of
weeding and there is little to do in the fields except that the

Economic Life

61

crops are in need of protection against the birds. This
work is generally done in rotation, one member of the
family group taking charge of the field one day and another
the next day. This gives all the members of the group an
opportunity of participating in dances and visiting the
markets to sell or buy.
Marketing begins when crops are ripe and have not yet
dried to be harvested. Various things are taken to markets,
principally bananas, yams, a variety of beans, tree peas,
maize, millet, potatoes and sugar-canes. In these markets
one finds all kinds of ornaments, articles of clothing, from
skins of animals to the Lancashire cotton, different types of
agricultural implements, running from digging-sticks to
hoes made in Birmingham or in Japan. There are also
sheep and goats, milk and butter-fat, etc.
There are two ways of exchanging goods, one by barter
and the other by money. The former is predominant, for
the majority of the people still adhere to the old form of
exchanging one article for another. For instance, if one
man has beans and he wants yams, he goes to the man who
has yams and is in need of beans and tells him: "I have my
beans and I want your yams." Then they argue as to how
many yams to a basket of beans. If they agree they exchange
there and then; if not, each goes his own way, looking for
someone else who will agree with him, for the exchange
depends entirely on individual buyer and seller.
There are also fixed prices for certain goods dictated by
the seasonal law of supply and demand. For instance, if
a man wants a cultivating-knife he goes to a smith who has
fixed a general price for each of his articles according to their
sizes. For example, a small knife is exchanged for a small
basket of millet or two small baskets of beans. Again, if a
woman wants an ornament she goes to a man or a woman

Facing Mount Kenya
who has them and there exchanges two heaps of sweet
potatoes or one heap of yams for a bracelet or an ear-ring.
In the markets things are bought and sold in small and
big quantities by people who have too much of one thing
and too little of the other. Take the case of a man who is
about to stage a big ceremonial feast, and perhaps has not
cultivated sufficient grain to enable him to display his
generosity to his friends. He takes one of his sheep or
goats to the market and exchanges it for three or four big
baskets of millet or for any other commodity that he lacks.
If a man has too many cows and fewer sheep and goats, he
takes one of his cows, especially one that has no religious
implications within the family group, and exchanges it for
ten or more sheep and goats. Sometimes there are people
who have been working for wages and had saved a
few shillings after paying their poll or hut taxes. When
one such returns to his home and wants to own a few of
these valued animals, which are the recognised standard of
wealth among the Gikuyu, he goes to the market and makes
a good bargain with the people who had brought their
sheep and goats to raise sufficient money for the Government taxes. In these markets one can buy almost any
conceivable thing that is available in the tribe. It is considered a sign of industry to be selling grain in the markets,
for it proves that one has not only cultivated sufficient for
the family, but also a surplus for accumulation of wealth.

Harvesting
In many cases the harvesting-time is the busiest period
for the majority of women, for the simple reason that they
are the managing directors of the food supply in their
respective family groups. Therefore it is considered right

Economic Life

63

and proper for the women to handle the grain and store it
according to the immediate and future needs of the family.
The work of harvesting is almost divided equally between
men and women. For while the women do the actual
harvesting and carrying the harvest home, the men cut or
root out maize or millet stalks, burn them and spread the
ashes in the field as a part of the manuring and to kill
certain insects. Men also make new granaries or repair the
old ones.
When the harvesting is completed, a woman's first
thought is to store sufficient grain to last her family until
the next harvest. After she has done so, and there is surplus
grain left, she consults with her husband. Then, if there is
something that the family needs, the surplus grain is sold
immediately in the markets to satisfy the needs. If there are
no immediate needs, the surplus grain is kept back and sold
later when there is a scarcity of that particular grain in the
markets.
The stored grain is dished out carefully by the wife, with
the view neither to be wasteful nor starve the family. She
prepares family menus with a variety of daily changes to
balance the diets. For example, if she had prepared sweet
potatoes and gruel for to-day's meal, to-morrow she will
cook a mixture of beans, maize, greens and perhaps bananas.
Although food is changed almost daily, the wife takes great
care not to exhaust the supply of one article of food.
So when there is plenty of beans and maize, and less bananas
and sweet potatoes, she cooks more of what is abundant and
less of what is scarce.
A wife who manages efficiently the economic affairs of
as well as other duties in her family group, is highly respected
not only by her group but by the entire community.

Facing Mount Kenya
Economic Value of Sheep and Goats and Cattle
We have seen that in the Gikuyu society almost every
man has a garden or gardens from which his immediate
needs are supplied. We have also dealt with the economic
aspects of the crops raised in these fields, and how they are
bartered in the markets or sold for money. Little has been
mentioned about the marketing of domestic animals, but
up to this point we have not yet discussed the economic
value of these animals. It is therefore necessary to give a
short description of how the Gikuyu look upon their cattle,
sheep and goats.
To a Gikuyu the cattle in the first place are merely a
display of wealth, for a man to be called rich he must
own a number of cattle. Because, while every family has a
number of sheep and goats, say, from one to hundreds,
only a small minority own cattle, and therefore to own a
cow or two is the first sign of being a wealthy man.
Apart from being the display of wealth, cattle playa
part in the economic life of the people. To start with, cow's
milk is used for babies by those who can afford it. The
milk is very little used in the Gikuyu diet except by those
who own a number of cows. Hides are used for various
purposes, for bedding, making sandals and straps for tying
and. carrying firewood and other loads. As a source of
meat or butter supply, cattle play a very small part.
Cows are never killed for food, except at a time of famine,
but bulls and oxen are now and again slaughtered for
occasional meat feasts (kerugo), and this is regarded as
luxurious and only practised by well-to-do persons.
Cows give the owner a prestige in the community, but
are never killed for any particular sacrificial or religious
ceremonies, except in very rare cases or when a bull or

Economic Life
ox is substituted for a male goat or a ram. As economic
assets cattle playa part in the marriage ceremony, where a
cow or more is given as marriage insurance (roracio), but
there, too, cattle are given as a substitute for sheep or goats,
each cow being valued at ten sheep or goats and a bull or
an ox at five sheep or goats.
In former days cattle had very little economic value to
the owners, apart from the fact that they were looked
upon as dignified and respected rich men. The milk was
not sold, but used by the herdsmen and by visitors, especially
warriors, who were the protectors of the villages against
Masai or other raiders. The rich men, who naturally had
more property to be protected, were responsible for feeding
the warriors in the way of milk and providing oxen for
meat feasts (irugo) to keep the warriors in good healthy
condition.
Sometimes the owner of cattle hardly had the pleasure of
drinking his cows' milk, especially if they were far away
from his homestead. In spite of this the owner of a large
number of cattle was sentimentally satisfied by praise names
conferred upon him by the community in their songs and
dances. Nowadays some people, especially those who are
near European t?wns, do sell their milk and derive a good
income from it. This income could be improved by introducing a better breed instead of keeping a number of cows
which give very little milk. From the economic point of
view the present breed of cattle reared by the Gikuyu is
very poor, and it would be a great advancement if the
Government could help the people to secure a few good
bulls for breeding, and gradually replace the inferior types
of cattle with better ones. This method would automatically
improve the problem of congestion in grazing areas which
faces the country at present, for people would learn the

66

Facing Mount Kenya

value of keeping a few cows which will be useful economically, instead of keeping a large number of cattle for
sentimental satisfaction.

Sheep and Goats as Standard Currency
In the Gikuyu country, before the introduction of the
European monetary system, sheep and goats were regarded
as the standard currency of the Gikuyu people.
The
price of almost everything was determined in terms of
sheep and goats (mhori). This system still operates among
the majority of the Gikuyu people who have not yet grasped
the idea of a monetary system and its value.
These domestic animals play an important role in the
economic, religious, and social life of the Gikuyu. A man
with a number of sheep and goats feels no less than a man
with a large bank balance. The people look upon these
animals as a good investment which gives them a yearly
income, for if a man has two or three good sheep or female
goats within a year they increase to six or more, and
people consider this a good profit. They would argue
saying that money is not a good investment, for one shilling
does not bear another shilling, whereas a sheep or goat
does. This, of course, is due to the ignorance of money
speculation, and so they say it is better to buy a sheep or
a goat instead of keeping shillings which, if buried in the
ground (the only form of saving money the majority, of the
people know), would rot and lose their value.
Sheep and goats, unlike cattle, are used for various
religious sacrifices and purifications.
They are the chief
means of supplying the people with meat, while the skins
are used as articles of clothing. Finally, without them a
man cannot get a wife, for it is sheep and goats that are

Economic Life
given as roraclo (marriage insurances). If a man has cash
money and he wants to get married he must, in the first
place, buy cattle or sheep and goats, because the parents
of the wife-to-be will not accept cash money as roracio.
To them coins have very little meaning and have no religious
or sentimental associations within the people's custom.
The real value of money is only realised when a man
takes it and buys a cow or sheep and goats, or pays the
Government taxes, otherwise money as such has little
function inside the Gikuyu country. With all the disadvantages connected with the rearing of sheep and goats,
they are still regarded generally as the only means of
expression of wealth. By disadvantages we mean that in
some cases young men have been ruined by spending years
earning money to buy these highly valued animals and
sometimes sickness invades a homestead and kills every
one of them in a few days. This means a loss of ten or
thirty pounds, which if it had been put in a savings bank,
would have escaped and help the young man to improve
his condition and standard of life. This is a question which
is very difficult to settle, for some people would argue that
the animals give better profit yearly, whereas shillings do
not multiply quickly and do not give the same sentimental
satisfaction. But let us hope that gradually people will be
able to decide which one of the two systems is suitable for
their advancement.

Trading with the Neighhouring Tribes
We have given a description of how the Gikuyu exchanged goods amongst themselves in the markets, and the
types of articles sold and hought. Having done so, we will
now enter into discussion of how the Gikuyu trade with

68

Facing Mount Kenya

their neighbours, i.e. the Masai and Wakamba.
The
articles of special value in trading 'With the Masai are spears,
swords, tobacco, gourds and red ochre. The Masai, who
are not agriculturalists, and who regard the cultivation of
soil as a crime against their gods, depend almost entirely
on the Gikuyu for the supply of the three last-mentioned
articles. Although the Masai have their own blacksmiths,
the spears made by the Gikuyu were and still are regarded
as the best.
There are inter-tribal markets where these goods are
exchanged, but, apart from these markets, sometimes a
group of men organise into a trading guild and take their
goods into the heart of the Masai country. In former days
this kind of trade was conducted in the homestead of a
friend who acted as the guide and protector of his friends
and their goods.
The Gikuyu, after collecting their trading goods, would
send for their friend or friends in Masailand, asking them
to meet the traders at the frontier and conduct them into
the country. Thus goods were taken to villages, and, after
exchanging them for sheep, the Gikuyu would return
escorted by their friends to the frontier to avoid any
molestation by the hostile warriors who would only be
too glad to have someone on whom to blood their spears.
The same thing happened when the Masai wanted to enter
into Gikuyuland for the purpose of trade.
Nowadays the trade between the two tribes is mostly
restricted to trading centres. Only those who can afford
to pay heavy licence fees to the British Government can
open a trading store in these centres.
As regards trade with the Wakamba, there are no special
articles as in the case of the Masai. In fact the Wakamba
being agriculturists grow almost the same crops as the

Economic Life
Gikuyu.
The two tribes are racially and linguistically
identical. It can be said that in the beginning of things
the Gikuyu and Wakamba were brothers, but how and
why they came to part is a matter requiring some
investigation.
In former days there was very little hostility between the
two tribes, and their trade depended on seasonal harvests. If
there was a shortage of food in Gikuyuland and abundance
in the Wakamba country, the Gikuyu went and bought
grain from the Wakamba, the exchange being sheep and
goats or cows and sometimes ivory. The same thing happened in the case of the Wakamba.
Apart from these
contacts, there were frequent and friendly visits from both
sides for trading or other purposes.
We may mention here that soft chains, snuff-boxes or
carriers, bows and arrows, witchcraft and herbal medicines
were among things exchanged in trading, or given as
presents to friends, in reciprocity which is the basic principle
of friendship. The friendly relation between the Gikuyu
and the Wakamba is still the same, except that free visiting
is now prohibited, and only those who have a special pass
from the British Government can visit either Gikuyu or
Wakamba country or other tribes.

CHAPTER

Industries
Ironwork

OR centuries the Gikuyu people have developed
the technique of procuring iron ore from the sand,
and so the use of iron tools has been well established
in the Gikuyu country from time immemorial. In Gikuyu
legends and stories we are told how, in the beginning
of things, the animals were divided into two sections
for domestication purposes.
The divider, Mogai, gave
one section of the animals to men and the other to
women.
At this time people did not possess any iron
tools; they used wooden knives. and spears. The women
took to slaughtering their animals for food and other
purposes;
they did this with wooden knives, and it
took a long time to kill and skin one animal. The legends
go on to tell us that owing to the pain inflicted on the
animals through this slow process of killing and skinning
with blunt wooden knives, the animals could not stand it
much longer. One night, when the women were sleeping,
the animals gathered together and decided to run away
from these cruel human beings. All the animals possessed
by the women ran away and scattered in the forests and
plains; at the same time they selected their own chiefs and

F

70

Industries

71

leaders and defended themselves from being captured by
the human beings. The lion and leopard were chosen as
the defenders of jungles; the elephant, buffalo and rhinoceros as the defenders of the forests; the hippopotamus as
the defender of rivers and lakes, and so on. From this
time the animals which were possessed by the women
became wild animals, and the men's animals, which at that
time were not used for killing, remained domesticated.
Women tried hard to get their animals back from the
forests and jungles, but they did not succeed; they pleaded
with the Mogai to help them get their animals back, but
Mogai would not listen to their petition, for he said that the
women had treated their animals cruelly and therefore he
had given them freedom to roam freely in the forests,
plains and jungles. When the men saw the crisis which
hadbefallen the women they held a conference and decided
to send a delegation to the Mogai and ask him what they
should do with their animals, which were increasing by
leaps and bounds. The delegates took with them a fine
lamb which was fawn-coloured all over its body. They told
Mogai that they wanted to sacrifice the lamb to him, but
they did not like to kill and skin it with the blunt wooden
knives for fear of losing their herds as had happened to the
women. To their request the Mogai replied: "You are
wise men, for you have remembered to seek my advice.
I can see that you know that I have given you these animals
and I have power to take them away from you. For your
faith in me I will give you good advice about how to get
better tools, not only for sacrifices, but also for your
general use. I will make you the masters of your animals
with new tools, but I command you to share these with
your unfortunate womenfolk."
At this juncture Mogai directed the men to a site in a

72

Facing Mount Kenya

river-bed and said to them: "Take sand from this site.
Dry it in the sun; then make a fire and put the sand therein,
and through this process you will get iron. I will give you
wisdom to make better tools and you will not have to use
blunt wooden tools any more."
From this time the
Gikuyu, following the advice of Mogai, entered into the
phase of metal or iron culture.
Apart from these legends and stories which have been
handed down from generation to generation, we have no
other records to show exactly when and how this evolution
took place.
The fact that the Gikuyu have been well acquainted with
the technique and the development of ironwork can be
proved by the number of iron implements and ornaments of
purely Gikuyu origin which are to be found in all branches
of activities in the Gikuyu community.
The chief iron
articles in the Gikuyu society are the following: spears,
swords, digging- and clearing-knives of different sizes, earand finger-rings, arrow heads, bracelets of various shapes
and sizes, axes and fine chains, hammers and tongs, tweezers,
etc.
With these preliminary remarks we will proceed to
describe how the work of procuring iron is done. The iron
is obtained from are. The method adopted by the Gikuyu
for this purpose of collecting iron are is that of washing
sand which is secured from certain districts and in a particular river. The sand is carefully washed in a river by
experienced men; the black substances that contain are
are put together and are handed over to the women and
children, who help to spread the are in the sun to dry.
It is worth noting that the whole family of a smith takes
part in the work, and the work is divided among the group.
When a man is busy in the river washing the sand, his wife

Industries

73

or wives and children are busy spreading the iron ore in the
sun to dry. This method of working may seem primitive
in the eyes of the machine-man of the Western world, but
nevertheless the system fulfilled the needs of the community. In the olden days there was only one great demand
for iron-namely,
during the time of initiation, when the
young warriors needed new equipment for war or protection. The chief demand in this direction was for spears
and swords. This did not necessarily mean that a new
supply of iron was to follow, for there was always a bit of
iron in every homestead left over from worn-out tools or
those which had broken and could not be mended. These
bits of iron were collected and put away to be used in the
future for supplying a spear or a sword to the son of the
homestead. For this reason the iron production, as mentioned above, was not everyday work. Some smiths had
never participated in the work of iron production;
they
lived on repairs and renewing or joining up together the
old bits of iron to produce a new tool or weapon.
After the sand containing iron ore is dried it is carried
to the smithy. There it is put in a fire made of a special
mixture of charcoals. Some of these are made from a
particular tree and others from a special banana plant.
The two kinds of charcoals are mixed. The banana charcoal
is said to have particular value in smelting iron. Its
substances help to put the pure iron together and to separate
it from impure matters.
Before the process of smelting is actually started, a short
ritual is performed by the smith and his assistants. The
ritual consists of sprinkling a little Gikuyu beer over the
furnace, accompanied by a few ceremonial words directed
to Mogai and the ancestral spirits. In the absence of beer
a little water fulfils the ritual duty. After the ceremony

74

Facing Mount Kenya

of invoking the spirits of ancestors and appealing to Mogai
for guidance and protection in the enterprise, the work of
smelting iron is proceeded with. Two bellows are employed
simultaneously to keep the fire burning. They are worked
by assistants, who learn the profession by means of watching
the smith doing the work. In other words, they learn
by example. The bellows are put in motion, the charcoals
are carefully laid, and then the sand is slowly sprinkled
over the burning fire by the trained hands of the smith.
The heat is kept at a regulated temperature by adding the
required amount of charcoals in the furnace. At the same
time the blowing of the bellows is kept in check. Sometimes the heat is intensified, and at other times it is slowed
down. In this way the temperature is kept at the required
degree, which reduces the ore to metallic iron, which is
technically called" blooms" (gelcama).
The smith, with his assistants, continue to work from
morning till the evening, especially when they have plenty
of sand containing ore to melt. In the evening the melted
iron is left in the furnace to cool. Early the next morning
the smith, followed by his assistants, takes a small quantity
of beer made of sugar-cane or honey. On his arrival at the
smithy he performs a short ceremony of greeting the
ancestral spirits who have guarded the work during the
night. The ceremony consists of sprinkling the beer over
and round the furnace and again over the working tools.
The communion between the smith and the ancestor spirits
in this respect is considered to be of great importance, for
the spirits of ancestors are said to be very closely connected
with ironwork, and especially male spirits. It is believed
that unless these are appeased they can render the ironwork
unsuccessful by causing the tools or weapons which are
made of the iron to break, and thus reduce the popularity

Industries

75

of the smith. This belief is founded on the ground that the
male ancestors have had their bitter experiences as warriors
and some of them had met their deaths in battle-fields in
which the iron weapons were used. And even those who
had not met their deaths in this way have suffered pain in
one way or another, by being wounded either in battle or
in the general activities of a warrior's life.
When the ritual of communing with the ancestral spirits
is completed, the iron" blooms," which have run together
into small lumps, are taken out from the furnace. These
are joined into a big heap by a mass of slag which has
flowed during the melting. After taking out the big pile
of slag the "blooms"
are knocked out and collected
together.
The next step that follows is to heat the
" blooms" and hammer a few of them together, according
to the quantity required, to make a spear or sword or other
iron articles. The irons thus beaten in heaps are known as
mondwa, and they are sold according to sizes.
If a man wants a spear he will not buy a ready-made spear
but the mondwa, and then pay the smith for making the
spear. Sometimes the same smith fulfils both tasks of
selling the mondwa and of making the spear. But there
are others who do not make iron, and their duty is
merely to make articles with material supplied by their
customers.
The smith clan holds an important position in the
community;
members of that clan are respected and
feared. In the first place they command respect because
of their skill in ironwork, without which the community
would have difficulty in obtaining the necessary implements
for various activities, for iron implements play an important
part in the economic, religious, social, and political life of
the Gikuyu. In the second place the smiths are feared for

Facing Mount Kenya
the fact that strong curses rest with the smith clan. If a
smith should- curse a man or a family there is no form of
purification that could cleanse the cursed individual or the
group. The curse consists of cutting a piece of red-hot
iron on an anvil and at the same time uttering spells, e.g.

Ng' ania wa Ng' ania arutwika ta kiriha geelce. Mahorl maalce
marohehenjeka, ngoro yake erotweka ta kiriha geeke. This
means: "May So-and-so (proper name given) be cut like
this iron. Let his lungs be smashed to smithereens. Let
his heart be cut off like this iron."

Hut-building
It is a common ambition of every Gikuyu young man to
own a hut or huts, which means implicitly to have a wife or
wives. The establishment of a homestead gives a man
special status in the community;
he is referred to as
muthuri (an elder), and is considered capable of holding
responsible position in tribal affairs. Thus, it is the desire
of every Gikuyu man to work hard and accumulate property
which will enable him to build a homestead of his own.
There is a proverb in Gikuyu which says: " Wega uumaga
na mocie," that is, the quality of a man is judged by his
homestead. With these few remarks we will proceed to
describe how a hut is built.
All Gikuyu huts are of round type, with wooden walls
and grass thatched roofs. The actual building of a hut
takes only one day; and as soon as it is completed, a new
fire is drilled from sacred fire-sticks, " githegethi na Geka kia
Igongona:" But in case of rebuilding, the fire from the old
hut is preserved to be transferred to the new hut. The fire
is ritually lit in the new hut, and after a short ceremony of
communing with the ancestral spirits the owner moves into

Industries

77

the new homestead.
Sometimes two or more huts are
built simultaneously, as in the· case of a man having more
than one wife or a large family which could not be housed
in one hut. But general custom requires that even a man
with one wife should have two huts, one for his wife's
private use and one for himself for general use. The
woman's hut is called nyomba. Here it is taboo for a mere
stranger to enter, because nyomba is considered as the
traditional sacred abode of the family and the proper place
to hold communion with their ancestral spirits. All aspects
of religious and magical ceremonies and sacrifices which
concern the family are centred around the nyomba. It is
for fear of defilement and ill-luck that strangers are not
allowed to cross this sacred threshold. The man's hut is
called thingira , in this, friends and casual visitors are
entertained.
Nowadays the system of having two huts for a man
with only one wife is dying out, owing to the heavy
burden of hut taxes imposed on the people by the British
Government.
The result has been congestion, whole
families being crowded in one hut, for many such families
can hardly maintain iheir livelihood and at the same time
afford to find money for hut taxation.
We have mentioned that a hut is built and occupied in
the same day; this statement may puzzle those who are not
acquainted with the Gikuyu method of building. To avoid
this, let us at once explain how the work that expedites
the putting up of a hut is organised. Most important of all
is the Gikuyu collective method of working. A few days
before the erection of a hut or huts the building materials
are collected. In doing this the division oflabour according
to sex plays an important role. The work of cutting wood
necessary for building falls on men; women take the

F acing Mount Kenya
responsibility of providing thatching grass and other
materials.
When a family is engaged in the work of building a
hut or huts the help of neighbours and friends is necessary
in order to expedite the work. A man goes round asking
his friends to help him, and at the same time telling them
what kind of building materials he would like them to
supply him with. In the same manner the wife visits
her women friends, requesting them to help in various ways.
Those who cannot take part in collecting building materials
are asked to help in providing food and drink for the
builders' feast, which is called" iruga ria mwako." On the
day appointed many of these friends will turn up, bringing
with them the required materials for building. The man
and his wife or wives receive their helpers joyfully and bid
them to sit down and rest. After all have arrived a feast is
provided, consisting of a variety of food and drink. During
the feasting this group of men and women entertain
themselves with traditional songs relating to team-work.
Before they part, a day is appointed when the actual building
of a hut or huts will take place.
It is obvious that without this system of team-work
it would take a man a long time to complete the work,
especially in a community where the system of paid labour
is traditionally unknown. In its place, mutual help guided
by the rules of give and take plays a significant part. In
every branch of work reciprocity is the fundamental
principle governing the relationship between a man and his
neighbours, and also between various groups or clans and
the tribe. If a man, after having been asked to give his
service, absents himself without a good reason, especially
when his neighbour has urgent work, such as building a hut
or a cattle kraal, which has to be completed in one day

Industries

79

(for it is feared that should a hut or a kraal be left unfinished
and unoccupied, evil spirits might dwell therein and,
therefore, cause constant misfortune to the future occupants
and their herd), the result will be that the defaulter will find
himself socially boycotted for his individualistic attitude.
When a man has thus been ostracised, " kohingwo," he will
have to pay fine of one sheep or a he-goat to his neighbours
for his bad behaviour. When the fine is paid, the animal is
slaughtered for a feast, and then, after a short ceremony of
reunion, the man's status as a good and helpful neighbour
is re-acknowledged.
After the building materials have been collected, the head
of the family selects a plot where he wishes to establish his
new homestead. In selecting the plot care is taken to see
that the land is not associated with any ancestral curse or
taboo. The plot must also be one that has been lawfully
acquired. The homestead must not be built on or near a
graveyard, or on a place where a fierce battle has taken
place, resulting in loss of lives. Such places are considered
as the resting homes for the departed spirits, and to disturb
them would mean to invoke their anger.
When these preliminary arrangements have been made,
the man prepares sugar-cane or honey beer for the foundation ceremony.
Early in the morning, on the day of
building a hut or huts, a small quantity of the beer is taken
to the selected plot and, in communion with the ancestral
spirits, it is sprinkled on the ground where the new home
is to be built. Sometimes milk or uncooked gruel, " gethambia," is preferred Ion this ceremony, according to the
custom of the clan to which the individual belongs. After
the ancestral spirits have been summoned to join in the
work of building, the friends who have gathered to help
their neighbour start to clear and to level the ground.

a

Then the foundation is marked according to the size of the
hut which a man wants. To make a good circle a kind of
string compass is employed. A stick is put in the centre
of the circle and a string tied to it, then a man holds one
end of the string and, after measuring the required paces,
he holds the string tight and then goes round, marking the
ground until the circle lines meet. This is called" gokurura
kiea:" When this is done the builders start digging holes
in the ground for the outer wall. The holes are about one
foot deep and about six inches in diameter. After this the
inner circle is marked, which divides the hut into several
apartments. Immediately the wall is erected and the roof
put on. This completes the men's work in building, leaving
the thatching to the womenfolk.
While the women are engaged in thatching, the men
retire to a feast which has been awaiting them. During
the feasting the men sing songs relating to the art of
building; those who are clever and hard workers are
highly praised in these songs; at the same time contemptuous phrases are uttered for laziness. In some
of the phrases men call on the women in teasing tones,
saying: "Look on those lazy-bones who are working
like chameleons, the sun is going down, do you want us
to make torches for you? Do hurry up and join us in
feasting, and let us utter blessings for the homestead before
the sun is completely gone down." To this the women
answer in chorus, saying: "You men, you lack the most
important art in building, namely, thatching. A wall and
an empty roof cannot protect you from heavy rain, nor
from burning sun. It is our careful thatching that makes a
hut worth living in. We are not chameleons, but we do
thatch our huts like' nyoni ya nyagathanga ' (this is the name
of a small bird in Gikuyu which is well known by its sweet

Industries

81

songs and the neatness of its nest)."
In many of the
Gikuyu cradle stories and legends nyoni ya nyagathanga
and its work is highly praised. This acts as an encouragement to both boys and girls to become industrious in their
future activities in life. It is characteristic of the Gikuyu
people to sing inspiring songs while performing a task,
for it is said: "to work in a happy mood is to make the
task easier, and to relieve the heart from fatigue." (" Koruta
wera na ngoro theru ni kohothia wera na konyihia
minoga.")
When the women have finally finished thatching they
join the men in feasting. Before the party comes to a close
the owner of the homestead brings the remainder of the
beer or the milk which has been sprinkled on the foundation; he hands it to a ceremonial elder, who after pouring
the liquid into a ritual horn, calls upon those present to
stand up. Then the ceremonial elder, with his hands
raised holding the horn, turns towards Kere-Nyaga (Mount
Kenya). In this position he chants a prayer, calling for
a blessing for the homestead and its future prosperity.
The following is the form of the prayer used for such an
occasion:
" Wee Githuri oikaraga Kere- Nyaga; kerathimo geaku
nikeo getomaga mecie ethegee. Namo marakara maku,
nemo mahukagia mecie.
Togogothaitha tweturaneire
ohamwe na ngoma cia aciari alto, Togokoria ate orinderere
mocie oyo na otome wethegee. Reke atumia ona mahio
mathathare, Thaaai, thathayai Ngai, thaaaai."
The following is the translation of the above prayer:
" You, the Great Elder, who dwells on the Kere-Nyaga,
your blessing allows homesteads to spread. Your anger
destroys homesteads. We beseech You, and in this we are

Facing Mount Kenya
in harmony with the spirits of our ancestors: we ask You
to guard this homestead and let it spread. Let the women,
herd and flock be prolific. ( Chorus) Peace, praise or beseech
ye, Ngai (God), peace be with us."
After this the homestead is declared open. The next
thing is to light the fire which we have mentioned in our
earlier description.
Two children, male and female, are
selected for this ritual; they are looked upon as a symbol
of peace and prosperity for the homestead. The ceremonial
elder hands the fire to the children and instructs them how
to light it; at the same time he gives them the ritual words
to be used in this connection. The children enter the hut,
with the elder following behind them, to see that the ritual
is correctly carried out. Behind this small procession the
owner of the homestead and his wife follow carrying firewood to kindle the fire, for it is considered as a bad omen
for such a fire to go out. After the fire has been properly
lit, things are moved in without any further ceremony.
Let us glance inside a woman's hut. It may be some
six paces from the entrance to the fire-place in the centre.
The roof is supported at the outside by the wall, in the
inside by a series of poles equidistant from the centre:
The poles fulfil a twofold purpose; besides supporting the
roof, they are the mainstays of partitions which divide
the hut into apartments. These apartments depend upon the
needs of the occupant-her
bedroom is essential, and no
less so is the store-room next door to it. Should a daughter
[ive with her mother, her room will be next to the storeroom, and should the woman keep one or two animals
(sheep or goats) for fattening, they will have their compartment farther round the wall, just inside the door, on the
right as you enter. These rooms will occupy the whole of
the right inside of the hut, leaving free only the space

Industries
between the fire-place and the inner circle of poles. Each
apartment communicates immediately with this space.
To the left of a person entering the hut is a long partition,
extending almost from the door to the woman's bedroom.
Between this and the outer wall the animals sleep at night.
The scheme is thus simple; first the fire-place, then the
circle in which people may sit, then the outer apartments.

The accompanying diagram will make this clear. A
woman's hut is considered as the cradle of the family
tradition; it has many taboos which, for the harmony and
the prosperity of the family, must be strictly observed.
Among other things, fire must be lit in the hut every evening, and there must be someone to sleep in it every night.
The wife is debarred by custom from having sexual
intercourse anywhere else but inside the hut.
Sexual
intercourse must not take place in the day-time, even with

Facing Mount Kenya
her husband, neither must it be performed whilst food
is being cooked, or the food will have to be thrown away,
for an act of this nature renders the food unclean and unfit
for human consumption.
Anyone eating such food will
have thahu (defilement), and will have to be cleansed by a
mondo mogo (witch-doctor), for it is feared that unless this
is done, disaster will befall such a man.
The man's hut, unlike that of the woman, is very simple;
it has only one partition, and sometimes none at all. When
there is one, it is used to divide the bedstead from the
fire-place. The rest of the hut is left open; this is to
provide a large sitting-place for the family and their
visitors. For the man's hut is used for general purposes,
whereas the woman's hut is strictly used for her private
purposes and family matters.
A well-built hut generally lasts for about ten or more
years; occasionally the roof has to be re-thatched, especially
in the interval between the heavy and the short rains.
The wall has also to be repaired every now and again;
holes between the wood are filled with cow or sheep dung.
This method serves two purposes;
in the first place it
keeps draughts out, and in the second it preserves the wood
and prevents it being eaten by the ants. The wood preserved in this way becomes useful in the future 'building of
new huts, especially when old ones are pulled down.
Some building materials have been with a family for a
considerable number of years, and they are looked upon as
sacred relics.

Type of Weapons used by the Gikuyu
From time immemorial Gikuyu have been well acquainted
with ironwork.
When and how they discovered this

Industries

8;

technique is very hard to say; but from the evidence
gathered from the tribal stories and legends it can be said
without hesitation that Gikuyu have been in possession of
iron tools and weapons for many centuries past. In some
of the old stories and legends, which were the only means
the Gikuyu had of keeping records of tribal 'historical
events, we are told how Tene and Agu, who are the
ancestors of the Gikuyu, used poisoned spears, kiheti, or
thiya na ndokoyo, for hunting elephants and other big
game. We are also told of Nderni who, unlike their forefathers the hunters, settled down and began to cultivate the
land by means of cutting down trees with iron tools.
The word ndemi is derived from the word tema, which
means cut, or gotema, to cut. Hence the word ndemi
means that which cuts or one who cuts. The tools and
weapons used by these people were of small types compared
to those in use at present.
With these few remarks we will proceed to describe
categorically the type of weapons which are used by the
Gikuyu to-day. The most important weapons are: (1)
spears; (2) swords; (3) bows and arrows; (4) shields; (5)
a variety of clubs and knobkerries;
and (6) slings. After
a boy has passed the initiation ceremony, which gives him
the status of a warrior, it is the duty of his father to supply
him with necessary weapons, for without these he cannot
command the respect of his fellow warriors. The prestige
of a family depends largely on the capability of its sons in
their activities amongst the warriors. In the first place the
sons are looked upon as the defenders of their family group,
and secondly, as the defenders of the collective tribal
interests.
In a country like Gikuyu it is necessary to have some
kind of weapons, especially spears and swords, not for
Ii

86

Facing Mount Kenya

tribal wars, as some people may think, but for self-defence
against the fierce wild animals. It is worth our while here
to note that the Kenya Government has put a ban on the
Africans carrying dangerous weapons, namely, spears,
swords, and bows and arrows. At the same time the
Europeans move freely in town and in country carrying
all sorts of fire-arms. The Africans, seeing these, marvel at
the European conception of" dangerous weapons."
Now let us return to our subject matter, the Gikuyu
weapons. We will give a short description of how they are
made and the materials they are made from. The spear,
the sword, and arrow-heads are made of steel or iron.
The work of manufacturing these articles falls on specialised
tribal blacksmiths. This profession is generally inherited
from father to son. The spear is made in two pieces, the
head, ithombe, and the foot, mora; these are joined together
with a piece of very hard wood, mote wa itimo, which serves
as a handle. The length of a warrior's spear is between
five and six feet, while the elder's spear is between four and
five feet, with a short wide head and short foot joined
together with a long piece of stick. The warrior's spear is
called mwenjerere, and the one which belongs to elders is
called kiherethi-the
name denotes its wide head. The
sword is from two to three feet, with its blade sharp on
both sides; it has a wooden handle and a scabbard. In
fighting, the sword is the last thing that a man would throw
at his enemy; its purpose is for fencing, and a Gikuyu
warrior is very proud of his sword, for he can handle it
with great dexterity. The art of fencing is taught from
childhood, and at the time when a man reaches the stage of
a warrior he is well qualified in the art of fighting.
The arrows are of two types; one with iron heads and
the other with wooden heads. After the arrows are shaped

Industries
they are smeared with deadly poison, ororo, and then
covered with a leather strap tied around. When this is
done they are carefully put in a quiver and kept in a cool
place. It is against tribal custom for anyone to use bows
and arrows in an ordinary fight; the chief use for the
weapon is hunting, and in former days it was used in tribal
wars. The shield is made of buffalo hide; the hide is
soaked and, in this state, it is put on a wooden frame, it is
then dried and put into shape. The clubs, or knobkerries,
are made in different types according to the user's taste,
the size is also determined by the strength of the owner,
for on many occasions it has to be thrown at an enemy and,
if it is too heavy or too light, it may be less effective. The
entire work of making these weapons and of carrying
them is restricted to men only.

Pottery

The Gikuyu have a well-established system of making
earthenware vessels. There are certain clans who specialise
in the pottery industry, and for centuries the profession
has been handed down from one generation to another.
We would like to remind our reader that the system of
division of labour between men and women, at home and
in trades, is very important among the Gikuyu. In the
pottery industry all the work, from start to finish, is done
by women; the digging of the clay, beating and softening
it, the moulding and drying, the burning of the pots, and
finally, marketing-all these are entirely the tasks of the
women. Men are debarred by custom from approaching
the moulding-place, especiallywhen the work is in progress.
Men are not allowed to touch any material associated with
this work. The presence of a man at the moulding-place

88

Facing Mount Kenya

is said to have a bad effect on the articles and causes the
pots to break when they are put on the fire. Should some
of the pots break, as they usually do, during the burningtime, the women always suspect that some ill-behaved man
has crept to the spot during the night and has spoiled their
work. To avoid this suspicion men keep away from this
sacred ground until the work is finished.
As the man holds supreme authority over his smithy,
so does the woman in her pottery industry.
Both sexes
have to obey and respect the custom governing these
divisions of labour; anyone disregarding this custom or
daring to cross over the prohibited ground is met with a
severe punishment, or is ostracised.
The pottery industry is not carried on all the year round,
but is restricted to certain seasons. The most favourable
time for making earthenware vessels is during the time when
crops are nearly ripe, and again after the harvest. It is
generally dry at this time, and this makes the clay more
suitable for moulding, for the dryer the clay is, the better
and more durable the pots become. The industry is carried
on with two purposes in view: firstly, to satisfy the family's
wants; and secondly, for marketing.
The latter is the
most important and deciding factor as to whether pots are
to be manufactured or not, for unless the potters are satisfied
that there is a good market for their articles they will not
undertake the task.
Very few potters have good pots for themselves; they
sell all the good ones to others, leaving themselves with the
bad ones; hence a well-known Gikuyu saying: "Moomhi
ar~gaga na ngeo," which means" Potter cooks with broken
pots."
This shows that the Gikuyu have developed a
system of trading far beyond working merely to satisfy
immediate or family needs.

Industries
Like many other trades, the pottery industry depends
entirely on good crops. It is always after a substantial
harvest or when one is expected, that the potters are kept
busy. During this time of prosperity many marriages are
contracted, and this increases the demand for new pots.
In keeping with tribal custom, a new bride must always
have new pots, as well as other household utensils. These
are supplied by her husband.

Basket-making
The basket industry is again carried on by women, but
unlike pottery, there is no restriction on men handling the
materials or the baskets whilst they are being made. The
only thing that is taboo for a man is to do the actual work.
He may collect the materials and prepare them ready to be
used by his female relatives or friends.
The baskets are made of strings from small shrubs called
mogio, mokeo, mwondwe, and mogotha. The barks are chewed
or beaten to soften and strengthen them; they are then
stretched and put in the sun to dry. The next process is to
wind them together into a long string about fifteen feet
long. Several of these are made into balls, similar to
those which European women use for knitting.
\Vhen
enough strings are prepared the work of knitting the basket,
keondo, is undertaken. Baskets are of different shapes and
sizes according to fashion and taste. The time required to
finish a 1ceondo depends entirely upon the woman's speed
and the leisure time she has in hand. Basket-knitting is
looked upon as a spare-time job; it is generally done
during conversations or travelling, or going to and from
work. The moment a woman reaches her work, namely,
weeding in the field or collecting firewood in the forest,

Facing Mount Kenya
the knitting IS put aside until the time of going home
after work.
Apart from baskets, keondo (pl. ciondo), there is another
kind which we will call trays, getaroro (large tray), getiti
(small tray). These are not knitted, but are sewn. A
creeper called moogo is cut into several pieces, then these are
sewn together.
Getaroro is used for winnowing and spreading grain in
the sun to dry; sometimes it is used for carrying grain.
The small tray, getiti, is used as a dish for serving or keeping
food cooked or uncooked. There is no taboo preventing
both sexes from undertaking the task of making these
articles; but customarily the work falls on men. Very
rarely is a woman seen doing it. When a woman is found
making getiti or getaroro it is a sign to indicate that she is a
widow and has no male relatives to support her. If a man
passing by sees such a woman engaged in making getiti or
getaroro he will not hesitate to seek her acquaintance because
she has displayed a symbol of free invitation.

Skin-tanning
The skin-tanning industry is one of the most important
trades among the Gikuyu; it takes the place of weaving,
which is practised in some African communities. The
importance of this industry rests on the fact that all the
Gikuyu men and women dress nationally in skins. To
meet this demand it is necessary for a Gikuyu family to
keep a number of sheep and goats and also cattle, not only
as a display of wealth, but also as a means of supplying
articles of clothing and food.
In every family group there are one or two members
specialising in the art of tanning skins and cutting them into

Industries
shape for making dresses. A man who performs this task
is called professionally" Mohari wa Njoa na Motemi Nguo,"
namely, " Tanner of skins and cutter of dresses." There
is a marked difference between a skin suitable for a man's
dress and one used for a woman's dress; not only do they
differ in quality, but also in the method employed in tanning
them. A skin for a woman's dress has to be made thin and
soft, for it is said that woman's body is made of a delicate
texture, and therefore it must have smooth material to
cover it. Therefore, a specialist takes minute care in preparing the materials so as to gain admiration and to reap a
good reward from his customers.
It is necessary to give here a short description of the
method used in preparing materials for men's and women's
clothing. For making a woman's garment the skin is first
pegged on the ground to dry; then a specialist takes it and,
with his skilled hands, peels off the hair (kohunyora Tooa)
leaving the skin with the required smoothness and thickness.
This process needs very careful handling with steady
hands; for it is easy to ruin the skin completely if by a slip
of the hand one peels off more than is necessary. If a
specialist spoils a skin he has to give the owner another one.
Some skins are suitable for the above treatment, but
others are treated differently. Instead of peeling off the
hair by hand, the hair is scraped off by a knife or by a small
axe called ithanwa Tea kohara njoa which is used for this
purpose only. When the task of taking off the hair is
completed, the skin is softened by rubbing it in the hands,
gotanduka rooa. After this the skin is ready to be measured
and cut into the required shape. A woman's skirt takes
about two skins and an upper garment needs three or four
skins. These may be sheep's or goat's, but they are not of
the same value. Goat's skin has more value and it gives

Facing Mount Kenya
longer wear; chief's wives generally wear garments of this
material. A woman's clothes consist of three pieces:
(I) upper garment, nguo ya ngoro; (2) skirt, mothuru ,
(3) apron, mwengu.
Let us now turn our attention to men's dress. Man,
unlike woman, has only one garment, gethii. A young
man wears a gethii made of kid skins or of a very small calf.
These are preferred because of their small and smooth
hairs. The gethii for young men are made short and cover
the body from the shoulders to just below the hips, leaving
the legs bare. The only other garment is an apron, gethere,
which is worn only for ceremonial dances. The elders
wear long gethii, chiefs and rich men have more elaborate
gethii made of fur, whilst the lower ranks wear gethii made
of sheep skins. In former days this rule was strictly adhered
to, but nowadays, owing to the introduction of blankets
and European clothes, the old custom which defined the
correct manner of dress is less observed. There is a great
tendency among the young men, from chief to commoner,
to adopt the system of wearing European clothes. The only
section of the population which is not so much affected is
the women. They are more conservative than the men and
they look upon the European dress as a piece of ugliness
and as a screen to hide deformities. Some will not entertain
the idea of having a son-in-law who has adopted the
European clothes unless he undresses before a witness.

Gikuyu Musical Instruments

Gikuyu people have very few musical instruments, but
this, of course, does not mean that they are not musicallyminded people. In the musical field the Gikuyu prefer to
use their vocal organs more than musical instruments. The

Industries

93

majority of their dances and songs are performed without
any musical instrument;
instead of these, vocalists fulfil
the task of supplying the music for a dance or song.
In the whole of the Gikuyu country there are only four
different kinds of musical instruments, namely, drum
(kehembe), large rattle (kegamba), small rattle (njingiri), and
flute (motoriro) ; each of these is used on a separate occasion.
In addition to the above list we can mention that there are
various kinds of horns which are sounded for ceremonial
purposes.
These can hardly be described as musical
instruments, but we can put them in the same category as
bugles.
We will now take the four Gikuyu musical instruments
and deal with them categorically, explaining in some detail
the role each plays in the life of the community. As far as
music is concerned, we can say definitely that the flute is
most prominent, and it can be said that a Gikuyu plays his
flute with a great sense of humour. It is not played professionally, but for the enjoyment and pleasure it gives to
the player.
Generally, this article is made out of bark or shrub, and
it is of a temporary nature. A certain shrub, called mokeo or
mogio, is cut according to the size of flute required. The
bark is slowly and carefully loosened by twisting the stem
gently from one end to the other. Finally the stem is
removed, leaving the hollow bark free to be used as a flute.
To make the flute effective, holes are cut for producing
several notes. There is no cut-and-dried rule as to how a
flute may be made or played.
The technique depends
entirely on the individual's taste. Some people prefer four
holes, others six or eight holes. The materials also differ;
some people like their flutes made out of bamboo; others
prefer the temporary one as mentioned above-which

94

Facing Mount Kenya

means having a new flute almost every day. Apart from
the materials described here, there is no other way of making
flutes among the Gikuyu. They do not use metal for this
purpose.
The Gikuyu flute is never used for leading a dance or a
song. It is played at a time of leisure, or as a comfort
when a man is in grief or feeling lonesome. It is mostly
used during the dry season when there is less work in the
field, especially before the harvest of crops sown during the
short rain (mbura ya mwere). This season is known as
marira-ini ma mwere-namely,
the season when millet is
ripe and is being protected from the birds. This task
requires a man to spend a whole day in the fields, starting
from about 4 a.m. to about 7 p.m. A high platform
(getara) is built in the middle of the field, and here a man
with a sling keeps a constant watch over his millet. Whenever he sees birds coming towards the millet field he throws
stones with his sling to drive the birds away. Millet is
highly valued as a special diet; it provides the community
with a very nourishing beverage (ochoro wa mwere), which
plays a very important part in feasts and ceremonies. Birds,
too, seem to like this crop very much, and it is not an easy
job to keep them away from it. Therefore it is imperative
that a man should keep on the look-out until the birds
retire to their nests in the evening. In this solitude the flute
becomes a comforting companion. A man does not play
the flute to amuse himself only, but also to provide soothing
melodies for the womenfolk in the neighbouring field.
Women do not participate in the art of playing flutes,
but they are very keen listeners, and a man who is a good
player becomes a favourite among his neighbours, especially
among the women. Such a man receives tokens (matego),
in the way of food and drink, from the women, as a"sign of

Industries

95

their appreciation of his art. During this season there is
always great competition among the flute-players.
Apart from this time, during which the flute is played
intensively, the only other occasion when it is heard is while
a man is walking leisurely, killing time, or while he is away
from home in the pasture, herding sheep and goats or
cattle. But the latter case is very rare, for some clans will
not allow their herdsmen to play the flute while the flock
is in the grazing field, for it is feared that sweet melodies
might invoke evil spirits and thus bring defilement to the
herds. It is also taboo (mogiro) to playa flute or to whistle
inside a hut, because it is believed that sweet music can
easily attract the attention of wandering evil spirits and lure
them to come and cause mischief inside the homestead.
The playing of the flutes is considered as an outdoor
amusement or relaxation, and the art is restricted to the
boys and young men. There is no taboo which prevents an
old man from playing a flute, but it is one of these social
etiquettes which divides various activities according to
age; and it is therefore out of place for an old man to
indulge in this art.
Next to the flute comes the drum (kehemhe). Unlike
many other African communities, where drums or tom-toms
are used intensively, in the functions of the Gikuyu, drums
are restricted to a very few ceremonial dances and songs.
The use of drums as musical instruments has been adopted
only in recent years; the idea was borrowed from the
Wakamba, who are the eastern neighbours of the Gikuyu.
The method of sending news by tom-toms, which is found
in many parts of Africa, does not exist in the Gikuyu
country. Its place is taken by horns (coro, sing., macoro, pl.),
The news received from the neighbouring tribes who use
tom-toms is relayed throughout the Gikuyu country by

Facing Mount Kenya
means of sounding particular horns, used only for this
purpose. This duty was assigned to special trained men
who were always in readiness to receive and transmit news.
But nowadays this method is very rarely used, owing to
the interference of the Europeans with the African institutions and the desire to suppress them by imposing Western
" civilisation" on the Africans. The Gikuyu drums are
used mainly to supply rhythms to particular swinging
dances and songs, called njong'wa. The only other occasion
when the drums are used is in a procession of young men
and young women when they are in a parade, keonano,
which takes place at the opening of seasonal day dances and
songs called gechu!cia !cia mothenya or kebata.
Further, there are two kinds of rattles, !cegamba and
njingiri, which play an important part in all Gikuyu dances.
We will first deal with the large rattles (kegamba, sing.;
ciegamba, pl.), These are made of oval sheets of iron which
are cut to the required size, from four to eight inches in
length. The ends are filed to a blunt point and then are
folded over until the edges are close together, leaving only
a very narrow opening;
the shape produced resembles a
banana fruit. Several iron bullets, ngaragari, are put inside
the folded iron sheet and, by rolling therein, musical sounds
are produced according to the movements of the man who
wears it. Kegamba is worn fastened below the knee, with a
strap which extends above that joint. It is worn only on
special occasions, such as war dances, initiation ceremonies,
kebata and nguro dances. The two last-mentioned dances
are performed when the warriors are displaying their
physical fitness and their dexterity in handling spears and
shields; and also their ability to perform high and long
jumps while carrying their weapons.
This training is
necessary, for it prepares the young men to be able to meet

Industries

97

any danger with confidence.
Through these exercises,
Gikuyu men become good runners, and some of them can
run many miles without stopping. This is important for a
community which has no mechanical aid in travelling, and it
becomes useful in times of pursuing an enemy or dangerous
animals.
Kegamba is used by men. The only time when women
wear it is during initiation ceremonies; its chief use here is
to provide rhythm to the dances.
The small rattles, njingiri, are made of the same material
as the large ones. The shape is the same, but the only
difference is the size. The size of njingiri runs from one to
two and a half inches. It is worn in the ordinary way of life.
I ts chief use is as an ornament and to provide walking
rhythm, and it is worn on the lower part of the ankle. Some
people prefer to wear only one of these rattles, but others
have sometimes more than a dozen threaded together on a
leather strap. These rattles are also used in training children
in the proper use of the right hand; the rattles are tied on a
child's wrist, and by tinkling the rattles a child strengthens
its right hand. Left-handedness is associated with bad
luck, and parents do their utmost to see that their children
are properly trained in the use of their right hands.

CHAPTER

V

System of Education
(prior to the advent of the European)

T

HE following pages will give a description of some
of the many features of the educational system of
the Gikuyu people prior to the introduction of
European rule. It is to be hoped that the descriptive
analysis of the system will illustrate the need for more
study of this subject because of its practical value to educationalists, whose assumed function it is to impart Western
education to the Africans. There are two strong reasons
for the conviction that this study win yield fruitful results.
The first is that, like the study of any living thing's growth,
it should give the European an understanding of the Gikuyu
development from a simpler to a more complex social
structure.
The study of the Gikuyu system of education
should reveal to European educationalists how the character
of individuals is formed within the family circle and then
within the local group, and then within the whole tribal
organisation through a course of initiation ceremonies, and
it should give them the process of character formation
in the routine of Gikuyu life-history with its numerous
age-groupings.
The second reason is that the study of the educational
systems of other countries like Germany and Japan has
98

System of Education

99

helped other nations to understand the German or Japanese
mind. It has shown what are the leading ideas, the scale of
values taught to the rising generation, the virtues which
are inculcated and the ambitions which are fostered.
Therefore, when the Europeans turn to Africa they should
ask what is the African's scheme of education, how it works
on the growing child, who controls it and what is the
mechanism of the process? Making these queries sympathetically, the Europeans will be able to find what are the
significant things in the tribal culture, what it is the community regards as all-important and indispensable to its
progress and self-maintenance. Careful study of the tribal
system of education, the economic, religious, and political
aspects of life will np doubt reveal the forces which hold
the tribe together and make it happy and strong.
In the following description it will be found that education begins at the time of birth and ends with death. The
child has to pass various stages of age-groupings with a
system of education defined for every status in life. The
parents take the responsibility of educating their children
until they reach the stage of tribal education. They aim at
instilling into the children what the Gikuyu call" otaari wa
mocie" or" kerera kia mocie," namely, educating the children
in the family and clan tradition. Apart from the system of
schools which has been introduced by the Europeans, there
is no special school building in the Gikuyu sense of the
word: the homestead is the school.
The education of very small children is entirely in the
hands of the mother and nurse. It is carried on through
the medium of lullabies. In these the whole history and
tradition of the family and clan are embodied and, by hearing these lullabies daily, it is easy for the children to
assimilate this early teaching without any strain. This is

100

Facing Mount Kenya

one of the methods by which the history of the people is
passed on from generation to generation. At the time when
the child begins to learn how to speak, care is taken by the
mother to teach the child correct manner of speech and to
acquaint him with all important names in the family, past
and present. These are given in songs to amuse the child,
who is never told that he is being taught. Moreover, the
child is left free to listen to these songs when he likes. If
the mother notices that he does not like certain songs, she
at once introduces others with different phrases and melody
embodying the same teaching.
When the child is able to speak, he can answer many
questions which are asked gently and naturally to test how
much he has learnt. Such questions as these might be
asked: What is your name? who is your father? What
is his age-group? What is the name of your grandfather?
And your great-grandfather?
What is the name of your
grandmother?
What are their age-groups?
Why were
they given such-and-such names for their age-groups?
This type of question goes back for several generations, and
small children are able to answer freely without any effort
or strain on their part. These questions are never asked
seriously, they are always taken in the form of amusement
or conversationally.
In this way the history and traditions
of the child's family (maternal and paternal) become a
stimulating influence in his life and form a fitting background
to his environment.
After passing the stage of infancy the education of the
child takes a different shape, the child is taught how to sit
and walk properly to avoid having bow legs, for a straight
figure is admired by Gikuyu, especially amongst the warriors
it is one of the qualities of handsomeness. A man or woman
with bow legs is looked upon as an ugly person. As soon

System of Education.

101

as the child can walk the sphere of his education is extended.
The lullabies and other songs are continued to soothe
children, especially when they are in bad mood; but this
age is considered the best time to teach the children how to
use their hands in various spheres of tribal activities. At
this juncture the parents take an almost equal responsibility,
and a system of co-education is introduced in the form of
children's games.
The parents do not particularly choose the kind of games
their children should play, they are left free to indulge in
any games that appeal to them, providing, of course, that
the game is not injurious to their health. Anyone observing
the children at their play will no doubt be impressed by the
freedom which characterises the period of childhood among
the Gikuyu. The children do most things in imitation of
their elders and illustrate in striking way the theory that
play is anticipatory of adult life. Their games are, in fact,
nothing more or less than a rehearsal prior to the performance of the activities which are the serious business of all the
members of the Gikuyu tribe. The little boys indulge in
fighting like big boys. Running and wrestling are very
common, and the best performer in these activities is marked
out for leadership. They play with small wooden spears,
and shields made of banana tree bark, bows and arrows,
sling and stones, and acquire no less proficiency in hitting
the mark. They play, too, the games of husbands and wives,
and build little models of houses and cattle-pens with the
material lying nearest to their hands. The little girls plait
baskets of grass and grind corn, like their mothers, and
make little pots of the local clay and cook imaginary dishes
of the same material. The boys play the role of husbands
and behave in the same way as they see their fathers do in
their respective homesteads.

102

Facing Mount Kenya

Of course, not all their games have this aspect of preparation for the serious business of life. Recreation is an
essential part of adult activities and those of children.
When the child has grown beyond babyhood, the father
takes charge of the boy's education, while the mother takes
the whole responsibility of the girl's education and a part
of the boy's education.
The father has to teach his boy various things. As an
agriculturist he has to take him in the garden for practical
training. He makes a digging-stick, mora, for his boy to
play with while the father is doing the actual work of weeding or turning the soil. Through watching his father in
these activities, the boy gradually learns how to handle his
digging-stick, and thus becomes a practical agriculturist.
While this training is going on, special attention is paid to
acquainting the child with the names of various plants and
roots and their uses, especially those which are used as
antidotes for insect or snake bites. If the father is a woodcarver, smith, hunter, bee-keeper, etc., he will teach the
boy by examples in the same way. Through moving in the
forests and jungles with his father the boy learns about
numerous wild fruits and flowers, and comes to know those
which are poisonous and those which are edible. Alongwith
these special tasks goes a very important general training.
The boy is taught about family, clan and tribal lands, and
their boundaries are carefully pointed out to him.
Care is taken to teach the boy how to be a good observer
and to reckon things by observation without counting
them, as counting, especially of sheep, goats, cattle or
people, is considered as one of the Gikuyu taboos, mogiro,
and one which would bring ill-luck to the people or animals
counted. For example, a man with a hundred head of cattle,
sheep and goats trains his son to know them by their colour

System of Education

103

only or by their size and type of horns, while everyone
of them has a special name.
To test the boy's power of observation and memory,
two or three herds from different homesteads are mixed,
and the boy is asked to separate them by picking out all that
belong to his herd. Sometimes some of the sheep and goats
are hidden, and when the flock comes to rest at midday the
boy is given a few minutes in which to inspect gothorima
and report. His report is very carefully noted by those in
charge of the boy's training. If he makes any mistake no
harsh remark is made, but quietly he is asked to go through
again and point out such-and-such a sheep or goat which
has been purposely hidden. By going through the inspection again he would at once notice his mistake. The elder
in charge of the herd would ask the boy to trace back in his
memory and explain at what time and place he last saw the
missing sheep or goat. In this way the weak point in the
memory training is noticed and corrected. In the case of
a hunter this training is far more intense, because the
intricacy of forest paths and the difficulty of tracing animals
demand the greatest power of observation.
During my
boyhood my special task in the family was to look after
our cattle, sheep and goats; therefore I had to go through
this training, and afterwards taught my brothers.
The mother also takes the same responsibility in teaching
her daughter all things concerning the domestic duties of a
wife in managing and harmonising the affairs of a homestead.
The girl's training in agriculture is the same as that of the
boy. The mother is in charge of the co-education of her
children. In the evening she teaches both boy and girl the
laws and customs, especially those governing the moral
code and general rules of etiquette in the community.
The teaching is carried on in the form of folklore and

4

10

Facing Mount Kenya

tribal legends. At the same time the children are given
mental exercises through amusing riddles and puzzles
which are told only in the evenings after meals, or while
food is being cooked.
There are children's dances held occasionally at which
praise songs are sung. The children merge insensibly into
the dances of later years, and it is amazing te see how a small
child can capture with his or her feet and bodily movement
the complicated, difficult rhythms which have been learned
by merely watching their elders and imitating them. These
dances are attended by almost every child in the district.
Among the spectators parents are prominent, their chief
interest being to observe the conduct of the children in
public dances and to judge how much they have absorbed
the things taught by the parents. Very strong criticism is
directed at the parents whose children do not behave
according to the approved tribal law of conduct.
Such
parents are considered to have neglected the important task
of preparing their children to become worthy members of
the community.
Special care is devoted to physical development, and many
of these dances are the means of providing healthy and
bodily exercise. In this respect boys have more facility
than girls. For apart from these dances, the boys have their
games of wrestling, running and jumping, sparring with
sticks and shields, lifting weights and stones and clubthrowing.
They have district fights, when one gang is
matched against another, or champions are put forward in a
wres-tling match. It can be said that through work and play
both sexes get their physical training. The girls have their
share in housework, nursing the babies, cutting and gathering firewood and fetching water. The boys are sent out
to herd the sheep and goats and the cattle. They help

System

of Education

105

their fathers in stumping the gardens, cutting trees and
building.
There is health-teaching for both boys and girls; they
learn early that certain things are not safe and regard them
as taboos. Children are trained not to go into a house
where there is small-pox, not to touch clothes of a leper, nor
touch a dead animal, or the bones of a dead man. These
and countless other prohibitions are part of the instruction
in health and bodily hygiene.
In all tribal education the emphasis lies on a particular
act of behaviour in a concrete situation. While the emphasis
lies in the sphere of behaviour, it is none the less true that
the growing child is acquiring a mass of knowledge all the
time. The very freedom which marks the period of childhood gives unrivalled opportunity for picking up all sorts
of information about the environment;
the child is not
handicapped by attending school and listening to formal
instruction which is for the most part unrelated to his
interests and needs. As he roams the country-side he learns
to distinguish a great variety of birds, animals, insects,
trees, grasses, fruits and flowers. His interests bring him
in contact with these things, since they constitute the
furnishings of his play activities. He does not observe or
understand them as lessons in natural history, but knows
their names and as much about their habits and life-history
as he needs for his purpose. When the boy is with his
father or the girl is with her mother in the garden, as they
constantly are, they learn about the birds they see, the birds
that are harmful to the crops, how they can he dealt with,
and what birds can be eaten. In the same way they learn
the trees that are good for firewood or building, for supporting the yams Dr propping the bananas, those that resist
white ants or make the best bee-hives, stools or grain

106

Facing Mount Kenya

mortars and pestles. But here again the knowledge is so
practical, so much preconditioned by behaviour, that it
can be taught and is taught mainly by doing what they are
told to do on particular occasions and by not being allowed
to do or to touch certain things that are always within their
expenence.
It is with personal relations, rather than with natural
phenomena, that the Gikuyu education is concerned right
from the very beginning.
Growing boys and girls learn
that they have one thing to learn which sums up all the
others, and that is the manners and deportment proper to
their station in the community. They see that their happiness in the homestead, their popularity with their playmates,
their present comforts and their future prospects depend on
knowing their place, giving respect and obedience where it
is due. Presumption, conceit and disobedience to those
above them are grave offences. The whole Gikuyu society
is graded by age and the prestige which accompanies
a status in age-grouping, and this is done in such a way that
even small children are aware of it. It is a commonplace to
say that in the Gikuyu society social obligations are
arranged and differentiated according to the system of agegroupings, but it is worth while to point out that this
obtains in lesser as well as in more important matters.
It
determines the different salutations used, the manners
people may adopt in eating certain foods, the different
tasks in homestead or garden; it rules habits of dress or
demeanour in the community;
and it explains the rights
of different people in judging cases, in exercising authority
in the clan or family, in ceremonial or religious proceedings.
It is in relation to this social ladder that the child's education must be studied if it is to be understood.
His life is
marked and his position known by the steps which denote

System of Education

I07

his progress from one stage or status to another. Among
the Gikuyu the first and least important is the piercing of
the ears, gotonya ndogera na mato. Ndogera, i.e. piercing
of the outer edge of the ears, is done when the child is
about four or five years. Gotonya mato, namely, piercing
of the lobe of the ears, is done when the girl is between
six and ten, but the boy's ears are not pierced until he is
ten or twelve. At the time when this is done the maternal
uncle claims five animals (four sheep or goats and one
lamb) before giving his permission. When a boy's ears are
pierced he advances from childhood to boyhood, he can
now accompany his father to a case as witness so that he
will be able to speak of it after his father is dead. But the
biggest and most drastic step in the latter is circumcision,
which admits a boyar girl to the full membership of the
community.
This used to be done only when a youth
could be expected to prove himself as a warrior.
The
customary age was thus eighteen or twenty. But nowadays
a boy goes through this ceremony between twelve and
sixteen. Then the youth "comes of age," he is "born
again." The difference in standing of the circumcised and
the uncircumcised is tremendous.
Father Buget points
out that the uncircumcised, kehee, has no rights of possession. He cannot build a homestead of his own. In the
days of tribal war he could not go to the battle-field; he
could only stay at home with the women and defend the
homestead. He cannot boast or brag or even appear to do
so. He is not allowed to wear the long hair of the mwanake,
circumcised youth;
it is taboo for him to have sexual
intercourse with circumcised girls. In meat feasts, he is not
allowed to eat certain joints; he cannot have a circumcised
man as an intimate friend. In contrast with all this, the
circumcised youth is a warrior, a dandy, a dancer, an eater

108

Facing Mount Kenya

of good food. He is full-grown, a proper man, a full
member of the tribe. He is now eligible to inherit property,
he can think seriously of marriage and of putting up his
own homestead. But he has now undertaken new responsibilities; if he errs in any way he is liable to punishment,
he will be told: "You have passed the period of childhood
and you cannot behave like this; you are circumcised and
you are a man to know right and wrong."
(We mondo
morome wa komenya ooru na wega.)
The next stage in educational advancement is marriage.
It is a superior status and has rights and duties corresponding. Then follows the birth of the first child, this allows the
parents to take part in the religious ceremonies. The father
is not yet an elder, that is reserved for a higher stage when
he has a child circumcised and ready for marriage. He
now becomes an elder of the lowest rank, or kamatimo, in
Gikuyu society. Every elder of this grade gives one sheep
to the kiama of his district; the sheep is slaughtered for a
ceremonial feast in which the candidates are sworn in.
Kamatimo are more or less assistants at the elders' courts
and cannot judge a case yet, they only listen to cases for
their legal training. They fetch wood and water and light
fires for their seniors. After two sheep or goats have been
offered the senior kamatimo elders become elders of the
kiama or Gikuyu Court of Elders. The elders of this
grade have a staff, motirima or mothegi, of a particular tree,
mongirima or motaathi, and a bunch of leaves, mataathl, to
designate their office. When the elders have advanced to
this status they are known as kiama kia mataathi. They
have power over others, for they have the prerogative
of administering Gikuyu law and justice. Of these elders
of the kiama kia mataathi, the eldest are called kiama kia
maturanguru, i.e, dignified elders, who form the inner

System of Education
circle of the kiama and settle the knotty points of law and
custom.
They wear special brass ear-rings, icohe, and
carry a bunch of ceremonial leaves, matura1}guru, as a
symbol of their authority. They decide the dates of circumcision feasts and the holding of the itwika ceremony when
the older generation of rulers gives place to another. Only
the elders of these two grades can take part in the Gikuyu
ceremonies at the sacred fig tree, mogumo.
This brief description of the social ladder gives the clue
to the Gikuyu educational system. Each step in the ladder
is marked by a corresponding standard of manners and
behaviour.
The uncircumcised boy is taught by hard
experience to pay respect to the circumcised youth, and
during circumcision proper he has to pay dearly for the
gaining of knowledge or initiation into the secrets proper
to full manhood. This is the" school" most characteristic
of many of the African societies, and its importance in the
life of a community is illustrated by the impressive nature
of the mysteries and methods used at this stage to mark the
entrance to manhood.
These initiation ceremonies are
described more fully in the chapter under that head. It
is to be noticed that the education given at initiation does
not concern only sex, but the youth is taught with equal
vividness and dramatic power the great lesson of respect
for elders, manners to superiors of different grades, and
how to help his country. The trials of circumcision teach
the youth how a man must bear pain, meet with misfortune
and bear himself like a warrior.
He is taught to think
matters over carefully and not to act on the impulse of the
moment. It is borne in on him that he must work hard in
the garden so that he may get the wherewithal to marry.
He is taught to obey parents and older people, to help men
and women who are old and enfeebled and destitute, and 10

110

Facing Mount Kenya

obey the leader elected by the people. He learns in particular how to behave to certain people of his wife's family, he
must use a special salutation to his mother and sister-in-law.
It is worth while to mention here that the European
educationalists have not realised the importance of this
teaching, and the result has been that the children who
have been taught under European influence have almost
forgotten or disregarded the Gikuyu customary law of
behaviour.
The large place given to sex in the initiation ceremonies
is often misunderstood by Europeans, as if sexual indulgence is encouraged for its own sake; the obscenity
of songs and dances and the profligacy associated with
many of these ceremonies are held to prove unusual moral
depravity. On the contrary the Africans look upon these
ceremonies as a final stage, in which boys and girls must be
given full knowledge in the matters relating to sex, to
prepare them for future activities in their own homesteads and in the community. In fact all the sex-teaching is
given with a social reference. Boys are taught to look
forward to marriage as a duty to themselves, to the clan
and the tribe. They have to provide for wife or wives and
children by working hard and multiplying sheep, goats
and cattle. The breeding of children and the breeding of
cattle, sheep and goats are regarded in the same moral
scheme as natural activities to be encouraged for the public
good. We shall see later how this applies to the girls.
At marriage the husband is taught his duties towards a
wife; to treat her well, to establish good relation with his
parents-in-law and to receive their blessing before he takes
their daughter to his home. So when a child is born he
is taught his duty to offer a present of a goat or a sheep to
his wife for her labour, in order that he may see the child.

System of Education

III

He is instructed when sexual intercourse may be resumed
and how he must respect the child's maternal relatives.
Similarly when the child has reached the stage of circumcision the father is taught the manners of the next stage,
the offering of a goat or sheep to the elders of kiama and
so on, that he may have the right to join and speak in the
ndundu ya kerera, or advisory council. This body is the
keeper of the tribal secrets, its membership is limited to a
few selected elders who have gone through a severe test
and have solemnly sworn not to reveal their secret to anyone
outside the group.
The same parallelism of grade privileges and knowledge
is seen in the training of girls. When a girl is ready to be
circumcised she is taught manners such as how to behave
when married. It is understood that she will be married
and bring wealth to her family so that a poor brother can
find the guarantee necessary for marriage. She will bear
many children, bring honour to her family and to the tribe,
and she will provide food for the poor relation. She is
taught to behave like a gentlewoman, not to raise her eyes
or voice talking to men in public, not to bathe in the open,
not to eat in the presence of men other than those of her
own age or kinsfolk. This teaching is given by her mother
and the older women who are: in the women's advisory
council, ndundu ya atumia. The women of this rank deal
with all matters concerning circumcision of girls, births and
other religious duties.
The girl is taught to treat strangers with the proper
mixture of courtesy and suspicion.
Respect for her
husband's people is inculcated and obedience to him; she
is warned against hasty and impetuous behaviour.
At
marriage she is again taught to obey her husband's father
and mother, to address them by those names of" father"

111

Facing Mount Kenya

and" mother" and to regard all the children and property
in her husband's homestead as hers and treat them with the
care she would give her most personal belongings. She is
also taught her husband's rights in sexual matters and her
rights over against his. When she has a boy- or a girl-child
old enough to be circumcised she learns what she must do
in giving presents to the older women that she may be
admitted to enter in their group.
The fundamental nature of personal relationships in the
scheme of education shows clearly how these things are
valued by the Gikuyu. This is clearly brought out in the
position of parents in the society. In fact, they might be
described as custodians of tradition representing the public
teaching on life and duty. They have the right to the
service of their children from earliest years, for it is said
that prosperity depends on the joint activities of all the
members of the family group. This is demonstrated in the
way girls share the duties of the homestead, cooking,
grinding, fetching water and firewood, planting and
cultivating, nursing small children. Both girls and boys
accompany their parents to the garden when they are small.
Little girls have tiny cultivating-knives or digging-sticks
which, when they are five years old, they can handle with
amazing skill with their right hand while with their left
they clear the soil away and gather the weeds and grass in
bundles. Boys go with their fathers to herd cattle, sheep
and goats, or to perform other tasks. To begin with, the
calves are in their charge, and later they can watch all the
animals, water them at noon and bring them home in
the evening. In this way they learn good and bad pasture,
how to milk, to feed the calves and to flay the skin of the
ani.nals, Similarly girls learn to carry babies, to feed, to
clean and put them to bed. What is important here is that

System of Education

113

all the work has this character of family duty. Boys and
girls not only learn all that boys and girls could learn
through an apprenticeship to some particular calling, but
they learn this almost incidentally.
The bigger things
they learn are the habits of helping their parents and
working under the system of reciprocity with other
people.
But they are also taught definitely at circumcision the
theory, as it were, of respect to their parents and kinsfolk. Under all circumstances they must stay with them
and share in their joys and sorrows. It will never do to leave
them and go off to see the world whenever they take the
notion, especially when their parents are in their old age.
They must give them clothes, look after their garden, herd
their cattle, sheep and goats, build their grain stores and
houses. It thus becomes a part of their outlook on life that
their parents shall not suffer want nor continue to labour
strenuously in their old age while their children can lend
a hand and do things to give them comfort.
This respect and duty to parents is further emphasised
by the fact that the youth or girl cannoe-advance from one
stage to another without the parent's will and active assistance. The satisfaction of all a boy's longings and ambitions
depends on the father's and family's consent. Without it
he cannot be circumcised. Without it he cannot be married,
for he has no property of his own, and marriage involves
gifts or exchanges which only the two families concerned
can arrange. He cannot even join in a meat feast, keruugu,
or a beer-drinking pa.r:_tywithout his father's permission.
He must bring beer for his father and mother and also for
uncles and aunts before he can take his share. Even in
snuff-taking the same respect must be shown. This custom
is regarded as a boy's demonstration of his gratitude and

Facing Mount Kenya
appreciation for his parents' careful duty and tenderness
rendered him during his childhood.
A disobedient or careless son or daughter is told: "If
you carryon like this you will never get married, you will
disgrace your parents and the clan." The obedient son
is always well rewarded when his father dies and the
inheritance comes to be divided. Among other things,
natural or supernatural, the curse of a dying father or mother
is the most dreadful thing that can befall a son or daughter.
The disobedient or careless son or daughter lives under the
fear of it every day. "Orokanyararwo ne ciana ciaku otogwo
onyarareete "_" May your children treat you with disrespect as you have treated me." This is the worst form of
sin or uncleanness and is the only one from which deliverance cannot be gained by purification. It is even transmitted
to a man's children. The father's or mother's position is
thus strengthened by religious sanctions. In the same way
he is the proper means of communication and fellowship
with his ancestors. As the nearest relation on earth, he is
the priest of the household, and is alone entitled to offer
the family sacrifices. In doing this he is supported by the
will of the ancestral spirits, if there is strife or dissension in
the family the spirits can intervene and punish the wrongdoer. These kinds of spirits are known as ngoma cia
rohuho, i.e. spirits of the wind. If after a quarrel one
party or his child falls ill, it is said that his ancestors are
angry with him and that they have sent the "spirits of
wind" to punish him. In this case a medicine man,
mondo mogo, is called in to find out what will appease the
offended spirits. He diagnoses the offence and prescribes a
suitable offering according to the nature of the case. If it
is serious, beer and a lamb have to be offered, otherwise beer
alone is sufficient. At once beer is prepared, and next

S..vstem of Education
morning, when the beer 1S ready, the family gather,
the officiating elder pours some of the beer on the
ground and calls aloud:
"Spirits of our ancestors,
do not be angry, we give you back the words we
spoke."
This is interesting as an illustration of the statement
that the family consists of all the members both living
and dead. Anything that disturbs that fellowship is
evil, and nothing disturbs the dead more than an offence
against family unity and loyalty. So by any harshness
or indifference to family claims the youth brings, so we
might say, divine vengeance on the whole family group
of which he is a member. Thus early and late, by rules of
conduct in individual instances, by the sentiment of the
group in which he lives, by rewards and punishments and
fears of ceremonial uncleanness, the younger generation
learns the respect and obedience due to parents. The older
generation do likewise.
The teaching 'Of social obligations is again emphasised
by the classification of age-groups to which we have already
referred. This binds together those of the same status in
ties of closest loyalty and devotion. Men circumcised at the
same time stand in the very closest relationship to each
other. When a man of the same age-group injures another
it is a serious magico-religious offence. They are like
blood brothers; they must not do any wrong to each other.
It ranks with an injury done to a member of one's own
family. The age-group (riika) is thus a powerful instrument for securing conformity with tribal usage. The
selfish or reckless youth is taught by the opinion of his
gang that it does not pay to incur displeasure. He will not
be called to eat with the others when food is going. He
may be put out of their dances, fined, or even ostracised

II6

Facing Mount Kenya

for a time. If he does not change his ways he will find his
old companions have deserted him.
The fellowship and unity of these age-groups is rather a
remarkable thing. It binds men from all parts of the
country, and though they may have been circumcised at
places hundreds of miles apart, it is of no consequence.
They are like old boys of the same school, though I question
whether the Europeans have any association with the same
high standards of mutual obligation except perhaps in time
of national emergency. The age-groups do more than bind
men of equal standing together. They further emphasise
the social grades of junior and senior, inferior and superior.
We see the same principle in evidence all through the various
grades. When an uncircumcised youth is travelling in the
same company as a circumcised youth, he may not drink
water until his superior has drunk, nor bathe in the river
above the spot where the latter is bathing.
So in the
distribution of food the order of precedence is observed.
What is true of uncircumcised and circumcised is true as
between the various circumcised groups.
The older
group takes precedence over the younger and has rights to
service and courtesy which the younger must acknowledge.
For instance, before a circumcised youth can take part in
the dance or wear long hair he must pay a goat or sheep,
mbori ya ihaki, which is eaten by the riika age-group a
year or two senior to his own. The whole organisation of
the community again enforces the lesson that behaviour
to other persons is what matters most.
Owing to the strength and numbers of the social ties
existing between members of the same family, clan and
age-group, and between different families and clans through
which the tribe is unified and solidified as one organic
whole, the community can be mobilised very easily for

System of Education

I17

corporate activity. House-building, cultivation, harvesting,
digging trap-pits, putting up fences around cultivated
fields, and building bridges, are usually done by the group;
hence the Gikuyu saying:
"Kamoinge koyaga ndere."
which means collective activities make heavy tasks easier.
In the old days sacrifices were offered and wars were waged
by the tribe as a whole or by the clan. Marriage contracts
and ceremonies are the affairs of families and not of individuals. Sometimes even cattle are bought by joint effort.
Thus the individual boy or girl soon learns to work with
and for other people. An old man who has no children of
his own is helped by his neighbour's children in almost
everything.
His hut is built, his garden dug, firewood is
cut and water is fetched for him. If his cattle, sheep or
goats are lost or in difficulties the children of his neighbour
will help to bring them back, at great pains and often at
considerable risk. The old man reciprocates by treating the
children as though they were his own. Children learn this
habit of communal work like others, not by verbal exhortations so much as by joining with older people in such social
services. They see the household and friends building a
house for somebody, when everyone brings poles for the
uprights or grass for thatching. They go with their relatives
to help in another man's garden, building his house or
his cattle-pens or granary. They help in provision of his
marriage feasts or brewing beer for a kinship ceremonial
party. All help given in this way is voluntary, and kinsfolk
are proud to help one another. There is no payment or
expectation of payment. They are well feasted, of course.
This is not regarded as payment, but as hospitality. The
whole thing rests on the principle of reciprocal obligations.
It is taken for granted that the neighbour whom you assist
in difficulty or whose house you help to build will do
K

1I8

Facing Mount Kenya

the same for you when in similar need. Those who do not
reciprocate these sentiments of neighbourliness are not in
favour, but there is a saying that even a bad man will not
lack labour in the time of emergency, especially if he needs
to build a hut; though in actual practice such a man may
find it difficult to obtain help. Just as the public opinion
of the age-group enjoins certain obligations of loyalty to
fellow-members, and just as the family edict may call for a
sheep or goat from every household for a sacrifice or a
patch of sugar-cane from every garden, so the public
opinion of the tribe fosters the sentiment of communal
labour on a reciprocal basis. As they work in the garden
of a man too old to work for himself, or help a widow with
no children of her own to call in, so they payoff a grudge
in common and combine to payoff the fine levied on one
of their number. For example, if one member of an agegroup is insulted and is physically unable to avenge the
injury, the other members of his age-group will co-operate
with him in attaining satisfaction. For an insult to one
member of an age-group is regarded as an insult to the
entire age-group.
Again, in the matter of paying off a
fine imposed by a senior warriors' age-group or by elders,
members of the particular age-group, riilca, will contribute
toward the payment of the fine on their fellow-member.
Naturally the tendency to adopt the habitual behaviour
of the age-group grows with the pride of sentiment in
belonging to it. Every clan and family has its heroes,
njamba, past and present. Their heroic deeds are related
and their praises sung round the fire of an evening. This is
one of the methods of instilling ambition and a sense of
duty into the hearts of the growing generation.
The child
or youth who does not give the service demanded of his
position will be told "you are not one of the family of

System of Education

119

So-and-so" (ndore wa mbari ya ng' ania) or (ndotoketie
mbari ya ng' ania). The good old days before the advent
of the Europeans are lauded to the skies. These were the
days of wars and national pride of heroes and great leaders
of the dance, .days when men went together to plunder,
when they were all brave, and no man deserted his friend;
their motto was " Njamba egoaga na erea enge," which
means together we fight and together we win or die.
of course, since the Gikuyu are not a society of angels,
adherence to these social rules depends on the morale and
courage of individuals.
The selfish or self-regarding man has no name or
reputation in the Gikuyu community.
An individualist is
looked upon with suspicion and is given a nickname of
mwebongia, one who works only for himself and is likely
to end up as a wizard. He may lack assistance when he
needs it. He cannot expect that everything he does will
prosper, for the weight of opinion makes him feel his
crime against society. Religious sanction works against
him, too, for Gikuyu religion is always on the side of
solidarity.
The aged and weak are under the special
protection of the ancestral spirits, and they are never far
away from home. Thus the labour of the hands, the begetting of children, the amassing of wealth in the form of land,
cattle, sheep and goats are, just as much as religious ceremonies, matters of family and clan sentiment.
In the Gikuyu community there is no really individual
affair, for everything has a moral and social reference. The
habit of corporate effort is but the other side of corporate
ownership;
and corporate responsibility is illustrated in
corporate work no less than in corporate sacrifice and
prayer.
In spite of the foreign elements which work against many

120

Facing Mount Kenya

of the Gikuyu institutions and the desire to implant the
system of wholesale Westernisation, this system of mutual
help and the tribal solidarity in social services, political and
economic activities are still maintained by the large majority
of the Gikuyu people. It is less practised among those
Gikuyu who have been Europeanised or detribalised, The
rest of the community look upon these people as mischiefmakers and breakers of the tribal traditions, and the general
disgusted cry is heard: "Mothongo ne athogonjire borori;"
i.e. the white man had spoiled and disgraced our country.
The rising generation is trained in beliefs and customs
necessary to the self-maintenance of the tribe and interrelation with the neighbouring tribes. The fundamental
needs of reproduction, extraction of food from the environ'ment, and social solidarity are recognised and met. The
tribal society not only maintains its existence, but secures
the continuity of its distinctive features over against other
tribes. We have therefore to ask ourselves whether a
system of education which proves so successful in realising
its particular objectives may not have some valuable
suggestion to offer or advice to give to the European whose
assumed task it is in these days to provide Western education
for the African.
The first and most obvious principle of educational value
which we see in the Gikuyu system of education is that the
instruction is always applied to an individual concrete
situation; behaviour is taught in relation to some particular
person. Whereas in Europe and America schools provide
courses in moral instruction or citizenship, the African is
taught how to behave to father or mother, grandparents,
and to other members of the kinship group, paternal and
maternal. Whereas European schools in Africa provide
training in nature study, woodwork, animal husbandry,

System of Education

121

etc., much of which is taught by general class instruction,
the tribal method is to teach the names of particular plants,
the use of different trees, or the management of a particular
herd of sheep and goats or cattle. After this the child is
left free to develop his own initiative by experiments and
through trial and error to acquire proficiency.
The striking thing in the Gikuyu system of education,
and the feature which most sharply distinguishes it from the
European system of education, is the primary place given to
personal relations. Each official statement of educational
policy repeats this well-worn declaration that the aim of
education must be the building of character and not the
mere acquisition of knowledge.
But European practice
falls short of this principle; knowledge is the dominating
objective in the European method of teaching in Africa as a
whole and, as long as exams. rule, it is hard to see how
anything else can be given primary importance.
While
the Westerner asserts that character formation is the chief
thing, he forgets that character is formed primarily through
relations with other people, and that there is really no other
way in which it can grow. Europeans assume that, given
the right knowledge and ideas, personal relations can be
left largely to take care of themselves, and this is perhaps
the most fundamental difference in outlook between Africans
and Europeans. It can be safely said that, in the European
system of education, school co-ordination, and especially
social subordination, marriage, the family, the school,
vocation, relation of people to the State, etc., are all regarded
as things which have grown up of themselves, as historical
forms which, however, are always capable, as such, of
change, and over which the free man, namely, the personality, must have authority. For freedom of personality is
the highest good, and co-ordination with other people and

122

Facing Mount Kenya

especially mutual subordination are on the contrary something accidental. Here it is worth while to ask a question
which seems very pertinent to our subject: "If it is true
that the European system of education aims at individuality,
is it then to be wondered at that Europeans educated if},
this way have some difficulty in finding the right place.
for the organic tribal relationships of the Africans? "
may sum it up by saying that to the Europeans" Individuality is the ideal of life," to the Africans the ideal is the
right relations with, and behaviour to, other people. No
doubt educational philosophy can make a higher synthesis
in which these two great truths are one, but the fact remains
that while the Europeans place the emphasis on one side the
Africans place it on the other.
In the European policy for African education it has been
suggested that its aim should be that of" conserving as far
as possible all sound and healthy elements in the fabric of
the African's social life." The Europeans seem, therefore,
to be committed to a far greater utilisation of the African's
social bonds.
The European educational system looks
forward to social groupings which are largely determined
by economic, professional and religious associations.
These are the spheres of social behaviour and the links
which bind people together in mutual obligations. With
the Africans it is far otherwise. The ties of family and
kinship, sex, and age-grouping, as we have seen, form the
basis of the whole structure of indigenous education.
Unless the Western education in Africa can keep these
bonds vital and strong it cannot be expected to mould the
African in a way which will make him fit in his community
on one hand and to establish good relations with the
outside world on the other. If the African is to derive
any benefit from Western education, his training should be

·We

System of Education

123

directed to the strengthening of these basic relationships
which are the foundation of moral sentiments and the
means of building up character. As Dr. Oldham writes in
the course of a review on Dr. Knak's book on African
problems: ... But whatever change may take place, men
will still have fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, children,
blood-relations, neighbours, companions of the same age
and fellow-workers, and whatever change may come, the
vital thing is that the sense of mutual obligation and
responsibility which is found in existing relations should
be conserved and express itself in the new conditions."
In one respect the method which we have traced in the
Gikuyu system of tribal education bears a remarkable
resemblance to one of the features of modern practice in
England and America. I refer to the stress now given to
learning through experience of life in a community. This
is the indirect method which, as we have seen, is the method
par excellence of the Gikuyu system. By this method
instruction is given, as it were, incidentally, as a mere
accompaniment to some activity. This is how the Gikuyu
boys and girls acquire most of their knowledge and learn
most of the rules of social behaviour.
This system is
precisely what American educators mean by the process
which Professor Kilpatrick defines as "Wholehearted,
purposeful activity proceeding in a social environment."
Here the motive power is provided by the desire to achieve
some purpose for which certain knowledge or certain skills
are necessary. But the knowledge is a side-issue, not the
aim of the process. Educationalists will testify to the fact
that knowledge and skill thus acquired are more likely-to
be retained, for, as has been aptly stated recently by a
prominent educator: "It is the side-issues that matter in
learning. The knowledge picked up as a side-issue becomes

124

Facing Mount Kenya

an assumption, and it is the things that are assumed that are
really learned." What is the most impressive about the
Gikuyu method of learning is that the knowledge thus
acquired is related to a practical need, and, therefore,
knowledge is merged into activity and can be recalled when
that activity is again required. Behaviour also is learned
from doing things together, and is therefore directed to
social activities from the outset. Thus the idea of education
as participation in the life of the community is most clearly
realised in Gikuyu society untouched
by Western
civilisation.
It is worth while to devote some attention to the European
educationalist in Africa and his approach to the problem.
As a teacher his first concern should be to establish a good
understanding with the people amongst whom he works,
and to learn how to appreciate what is good in the tribal
law and custom of that particular community. The importance of this point is that such an attitude would serve as a
connecting-link between the p'upils in the schools and the
rest of the community.
In the past there has been too much of " civilising and
uplifting poor savages." This policy has been based on
preconceived ideas that the African cultures are" primitive,"
and as such, belong to the past and can only be looked upon
as antiquarian relics fit only for museums. The European
should realise that there is something to learn from the
African and a great deal about him to understand, and that
the burden could be made easier if a policy of" give and
take" could be adopted. We may mention here that the
African who is being civilised looks upon this "civilisation" with great fear mingled with suspicion. Above all,
he finds that socially and religiously he has been torn away
from his family and tribal organisation. The new civilisa-

System

of

Education

tion he is supposed to acquire neither prepares him for the
proper functions of a European mode of life nor for
African life; he is left floundering between the two social
forces. European educationalists and others, especially
those who are guided by racial prejudice and preconceived
ideas of what is good for the African, usually fail to take
cognisance of this vital fact. This may be due to studied
indifference or to an inexcusably meagre knowledge of the
functions of African institutions and a lack of intimate
contact with the real social life of the people they presume
to teach.
The teacher may want to make friends with his pupils,
to help them in their difficulties, and to share their thoughts
and feelings. Soon he discovers, or should discover, the
peculiar difficulties of the African language. It is easy,
sometimes, to acquire a sufficient facility for many subjects
of instruction, but the teacher needs more than this. If
he is really in earnest he will no doubt find that it is impossible with only a superficial knowledge of the language to
translate many of the most important terms of social
intercourse into African speech. As Professor Malinowski
writes: "All words which express religious beliefs, moral
values, or specific technical or ritual proceedings, can only
be rendered by reference to the social organisation of the
tribe, their beliefs, practices, education and economics.
The study of a native language must go hand in hand with,
the study of its culture."
It can be stated definitely here that the study of the above
subjects is not so easy as some people may think. The
European should devote more time to the study of African
language and culture before he starts teaching in Africa, for
without a proper knowledge of the functions of African
institutions, the more the European tries to influence his

126

Facing Mount Kenya

pupils in the direction of new habits, standards of life
and general Europeanisation,
the more he comes up
against a social background which he does not understand.
Without previous training in African ways of life, the
European may get on well enough in the teaching of
arithmetic or the imparting of knowledge of geography
based on a superficial knowledge of the environment.
In doing this the teacher follows the adopted educational
policy of educating the Africans in the ways which the
Europeans think fit for the" poor savages";
a policy that
has been carried out without due regard for the ideals and
aspirations of the people concerned. But that would not
be the correct approach if, as is so vociferously proclaimed,
the European is out in Africa for the improved health of the
African and for the standards of life and the economic,
social, and political status of the African.
By ignoring the African's point of view and by insisting
that pupils should adopt the European methods, whether the
technique fits in with their mode of life or not, the teacher
creates conflicts of ideas in the mental outlook of his pupils,
then he turns to ask himself: "What sort of homes do the
boys or girls come from, how have they been brought up ? "
He then jumps into a paternal conclusion:
"The· new
ideas must be implanted to replace the old." This paternal
determination may seem to be working smoothly for a
time in the school, class-room or dormitory, but soon
interest flags and effort decreases, owing to the fact that the
new system of education is not correlated with the African
background;
thus it has been very difficult for the African
to comprehend it or to realise from it any potential benefits
that it may have for him.
If then the teacher is given to thinking over his work
and wants an atmosphere of keenness in the school, of

System of Education

127

duties voluntarily and cheerfully discharged and responsibilities accepted for house, team, or school, he is bound to
ask himself: "What it is that will maintain effort and
stimulate interest? What motive will keep the pupils at
their best? What system will leave them proud and
satisfied to belong to the school as well as to the rest of their
community?"
Even when he has solved this problem
there remains another and a hard one: "Why do the
European standards and habits fail to carryover into the
home life of the pupils? Is it only the pull of the backward
environment or is he up against something difficult,
prejudices, fears, a whole system of thought deeply entrenched and stubbornly opposed to progress and change? "
Further, the teacher might wish to see the Western ideas
carried by the pupils into the community.
Yet this is
precisely the point where the teacher is disappointed.
Thus sooner or later he becomes either disillusioned or
cynical, feeling that these people are too stupid and obstinate
to learn anything else.
What the teacher has failed to see is not that the old
social structure cannot adapt itself rapidly enough to
changed conditions, but that there is a new trend of thought
among young Africans in a new environment; that is, their
modern ideals of life and aspiration. The European sees,
though he may not understand, that African life is changing
with alarming rapidity, that there is disruption and discontent in the body politic, and that the most aggressive
individuals are often the least desirable. With a better
understanding of the African social structure, an educationalist would be able to adopt a practical theory and
method to suit the situation, and to satisfy the African
aspiration, so that education, instead of creating confusions,
might help to promote progress, and at the same time to

128

Facing Mount Kenya

preserve all that is best in the traditions of the African
people and assist them to create a new culture which,
though its roots are still in the soil, is yet modified to meet
the pressure of modern conditions. A more sympathetic
attitude would help the teacher to change from what is
called "educating the native along his own lines," to
educating the African for leadership in his community and
people, and to make him fit to stand by himself under the
strenuous conditions of the modern world.
It is important for the European teacher to realise that
" he is not pouring new wine into new bottles, but into
very old bottles."
But how can he discover the exact
flavour of the old vintage, and where is the cellar to be seen?
He may set out to learn something of family, clan and
tribal organisation, the rights and duties of individuals
within the society, and the rules which determine the conduct of any individual with the context of the whole.
But after a sketchy study of these institutions, he thinks that
he knows all about the mental outlook of his pupils, what
they believe and what they do not believe, how they regard
themselves, and the world of nature and the society of
which they form a part. The assumption of knowing the
African's mind has been very often heard in the usual
phraseology = "I have lived for many years amongst the
Africans and I know them very well." Yet this is far from
the actual fact, for there is a great difference between
" living" among a people and" knowing" them. While a
European can learn something of the externals of African
life, its system of kinship and classification, its peculiar
arts and picturesque ceremonial, he may still have not yet
reached the heart of the problem. In the mass of detail
presented to him in what is called" authoritative books,"
he often loses his way as in a maze of knowledge not yet

System of Education

129

intelligible because not yet related. With his preconceived
ideas, mingled with prejudices) he fails to achieve a more
sympathetic and imaginative knowledge, a more human
and inward appreciation of the living people, the pupils he
teaches, the people he meets on the roads and watches in
the gardens. In a word he fails to understand the African
with his instinctive tendencies (no doubt very like his
own), but trained from his earliest days to habitual ideas,
inhibitions and forms of self-expression which have been
handed down from one generation to another and which
are foreign, if not absurd, to the European in Africa.

CHAPTER

VI

Initiation of Boys and Girls
HE custom of clitoridectomy of girls, which we
are going to describe here, has been strongly
attacked by a number of influential European
agencies-missionary,
sentimental pro-African, Government, educational and medical authorities.
We think it
necessary to give a short historical background of the
method employed by these bodies in attacking the custom
of clitoridectomy of girls.
It) 1929, after several attempts to break down the custom,
the Church of Scotland Mission to Gikuyu issued an order
demanding that all their followers and those who wish their
children to attend schools should pledge themselves that
they will not in any way adhere to or support this custom,
and that they will not let their children undergo the
irunanon rite. This raised a great controversy between
the missionary and the Gikuyu. The matter was taken up
seriously by- both educated and uneducated Gikuyu.
Children of those who did not denounce the custom were
debarred from attending the missionary schools. People
petitioned the Government and educational authorities.
During the petitioning period many of these deserted
schools and churches were used for storing maize and

T

130

Initiation of Boys and Girls

131

potatoes.
A "gentlemen's
agreement"
was reached
between the Government and the missionaries. The ban
on children attending the schools was lifted, but the
missionaries maintained that teachers must be only those
who had denounced the custom, for they hoped that
teachers with this qualification would be able to mould the
children in the way favourable to the missionary attitude.
People were indignant about this decision and at once
demanded the right to establish their own schools where
they could teach their children without interference with
the group custom. The cry for schools was raised high,
and the result was the foundation of Gikuyu independent
schools and Kareng'a schools. These schools are entirely
free from missionary influence, both in educational and
religious matters.
In 1930 the question of the custom of clitoridectomy
was raised in the House of Commons and a committee
of Members of Parliament was appointed to investigate the
matter.
The members of the committee included the
Duchess of AthoIl, Colonel Josiah Wedgwood, C. R.
Buxton and others. The writer was invited to attend the
committee meeting and give the Gikuyu's point of view.
It was then agreed that the best way to tackle the problem
was through education and not by force of an enactment,
and that the best way was to leave the people concerned
free to choose what custom was best suited to their changing
conditions.
In 1931 a conference on African children was held in
Geneva under the auspices of the Save the Children Fund.
In this conference several European delegates urged that the
time was ripe when this "barbarous custom" should be
abolished, and that, like all other" heathen" customs, it
could be abolished at once by law. That it was the duty of

132

F acing Mount Kenya

the Conference, for the sake of the African children, to call
upon the Governments under which the customs of this
nature were practised to pass laws making it a criminal
offence for anyone who should be found guilty of practising
the custom of clitoridectomy.
However, this urge for abolishing a people's social
custom by force of law was not wholeheartedly accepted by
the majority of the delegates in the Conference. General
opinion was for education which will enable the people to
choose what customs to keep and which ones they would
like to get rid of.
It should be pointed out here that there is a strong community of educated Gikuyu opinion in defence of this
custom. In the matrimonial relation, the rite de passage
is the deciding factor. No proper Gikuyu would dream
of marrying a girl who has not been circumcised, and
vice versa. It is taboo for a Gikuyu man or woman to
have sexual relations with someone who has not undergone
this operation. If it happens, a man or a woman must
go through a ceremonial purification, lcorutwo thahu. or
gotahikio megiro-namely, ritual vomiting of the evil deeds.
A few detribalised Gikuyu, while they are away from home
for some years, have thought fit to denounce the custom
and to marry uncircumcised girls, especially from coastal
tribes, thinking that they could bring them back to their
fathers' homes without offending the parents. But to their
surprise they found that their fathers, mothers, brothers
and sisters, following the tribal custom, are not prepared
to welcome as a relative-in-law anyone who has not
fulfilled the ritual qualifications for matrimony. Therefore
a problem has faced these semi-detribalised Gikuyu when
they wanted to return to their homeland. Their parents
have demanded that if their sons wished to settle down and

Initiation of Boys and Girls

133

have the blessings of the family and the clan, they must
divorce the wife married outside the rigid tribal custom
and then marry a girl with the approved tribal qualifications.
Failing this, they have been turned out and disinherited.
In our short survey we have mentioned how the custom
of clitoridectomy has been attacked on one side, and
on the other how it has been defended. In view of these
points the important problem is an anthropological one:
it is unintelligent to discuss the emotional attitudes of
either side, or to take violent sides in the question, without
understanding the reasons why the educated, intelligent
Gikuyu still cling to this custom.
The real argument lies not in the defence of the surgical
operation or its details, but in the understanding of a very
important fact in the tribal psychology of the Gikuyunamely, that this operation is still regarded as the very
essence of an institution which has enormous educational,
social, moral, and religious implications, quite from
the operation itself. For the present it is impossible for a
member of the tribe to imagine an initiation without
clitoridectomy.
Therefore the abolition of the surgical
element in this custom means to the Gikuyu the abolition
of the whole institution.
The real anthropological study, therefore, is to show that
clitoridectomy, like Jewish circumcision, is a mere bodily
mutilation which, however, is regarded as the conditio
sine qua non of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion,
and morality.
The initiation of both sexes is the most important custom
among the Gikuyu. It is looked upon as a deciding factor
in giving a boy or girl the status of manhood or womanhood
in the Gikuyu community.
This custom is adhered to by
the vast majority of African peoples and is found in almost
L

Facing Mount Kenya
every part of the continent. It is therefore necessary to
examine the facts attached to this widespread custom in
order to have some idea why the African peoples
cling to this custom which, in the eyes of a good many
Europeans, is nothing but a "horrible"
and "painful"
practice, suitable only to barbarians.
In the first place it is necessary to give the readers a
clear picture of why and how this important sociobiological custom is performed.

Name of the Custom
The Gikuyu name for this custom of rite depassage from
childhood to adulthood is irua, i.e. circumcision, or trimming the genital organs of both sexes. The dances and
songs connected with the initiation ceremony are called
mambura, i.e, rituals or divine services. It is important to
note that the moral code of the tribe is bound up with this
custom and that it symbolises the unification of the whole
tribal organisation.
This is the principal reason why irua
plays such an important part in the life of the Gikuyu
people.
The irua marks the commencement of participation in
various governing groups in the tribal administration,
because the real age-groups begin from the day of the
physical operation. The history and legends of the people
are explained and remembered according to the names
given to various age-groups at the time of the initiation
ceremony. For example, if a devastating famine occurred
at the time of the initiation, that particular irua group would
be known as " famine" (ng' aragu). In the same way, the
Gikuyu have been able to record the time when the European introduced a number of maladies such as syphilis into

Initiation of Boys and Girls

135

Gikuyu country, for those initiated at the time when this
disease first showed itself are called gatego, i.e, syphilis.
Historical events are recorded and remembered in the same
manner. Without this custom a tribe which had no written
records would not have been able to keep a record of important events and happenings in the life of the Gikuyu
nation.
Any Gikuyu child who is not corrupted by
detribalisation is able to record in his mind the whole
history and origin of the Gikuyu people through the
medium of such names as Agu, Ndemi and Mathathi,
etc., who were initiated hundreds of years ago.
For years there has been much criticism and agitation
against irua of girls by certain misinformed missionary
societies in East Africa, who see only the surgical side of the
irua, and, without investigating the psychological importance attached to this custom by the Gikuyu, these missionaries draw their conclusion that the irua of girls in nothing
but a barbarous practice and, as such, should be abolished
by law.
On the other hand, the Gikuyu look upon these religious
fanatics with great suspicion. The overwhelming majority
of them believe that it is the secret aim of those who attack
this centuries-old custom to disintegrate their social order
and thereby hasten their Europeanisation.
The abolition of
trua will destroy the tribal symbol which identifies the agegroups, and prevent the Gikuyu from perpetuating that
spirit of collectivism and national solidarity which they
have been able to maintain from time immemorial.

Preparing for Initiation
About a fortnight before the day of initiation the girl
is put on a special diet, namely, njahi and ngima ya ogembe;

Facing Mount Kenya
composed of a particular kind of Gikuyu bean (njahe), and
together with a stiff porridge made of a small kind of grain
(ogembe) ground into flour and mixed with water and oil.
This diet is used in order to prevent the loss of blood at
the time of initiation (physical operation) and also to ensure
immediate healing of the wound, as well as a precaution
against blood poisoning. The girl is properly taken care of
by her sponsor, motiiri, who examines her and gives her
all necessary instructions about the initiation ceremony.
In this examination attention is directed to ascertaining
that the girl is not near maturity and that menstruation is
not likely to begin for at least a month after irua and the
healing of the wound. She is also closely questioned to
verify that she never had sexual intercourse or indulged in
masturbation.
If she has broken any of the prohibitions of
the Gikuyu social codes, the girl makes a confession to the
motiiri, who reports the confession to the girl's parents.
The service of a motahekania, or a " family purifier," is then
engaged to purify (koruta mogiro) the girl and prepare her
for the irua.
Three or four days prior to the actual physical operation
the girl is taken to the homestead where the ceremony is to
take place. There she meets the rest of the initiates. The
initiates are all introduced to the elder of the homestead
and his wife, who adopt them as their children for the pmpose of the irua. On this special day the boys and girls of
the irua group, together with their relatives and friends,
join in singing and dancing the whole night, and at the
same time beating sugar-canes in mortars to prepare a
special kind of beer for a ceremony called koraria morungu,
which is supposed to keep the gods awake. This ceremony
is considered an act of communion with the ancestral god
(morungu), whose protection is invoked to guide and protect

Initiation of Boys and Girls

137

the initiates through the irua ceremony and at the same time
to give them the wisdom of their forefathers. During the
dancing and singing no girl or boy is allowed to go to bed,
as this is regarded as missing the opportunity of direct
contact with morungu, which would result in misfortune at
the time of the irua,
On the morning after koraria morungu the fathers and
mothers of the initiates are gathered together and partake of
a feast at which the specially prepared beer is freely indulged
in. This is done in the yard of the homestead. They sit in
a circle. Then the children are called, one by one, according
to their order of adoption.
Now the ceremony called
korathima ciana, or blessing the children, is performed. It
includes marking certain symbols upon the forehead, the
cheeks, round the eyes, the nose, the throat and the navel
of the initiates with a sort of white chalk called ira (snow)
obtained from Mount Kenya (Kere-Nyaga), the abode of the
gods. One elder, who holds the senior office in the ceremonial council, or athuri a kerera, is entrusted with this
duty of marking. He places the ira in the palm of his left
hand and, dipping his right thumb in it, marks his candidates
as they pass, one by one, before him. An old woman
who is also a member of the ceremonial council follows
and, with oil carried in a bottle-shaped calabash (kinando),
anoints each girl on the head, round the neck and on the
feet. The rest of the elders join in chorus, uttering blessings
as each child passes by.
On this occasion they use
ceremonial language such as this: "Ciana irogea thaai,
Thathayai Ngai thaau-ai-ciana irogea thai, thaaai-thai-thaithaaa-i," which means-s-" Peace be with the children.
Beseech Ngai (God) peace-peace,
peace. Let peace be
with the children-peace."
When this part of the ceremony is completed, the boys

138

Facing Mount Kenya

and girls leave the homestead, escorted by their relatives
and friends, for their respective homes, singing festive songs
as they go along.
On their arrival home, the girl is met at the entrance of
the homestead by young married and unmarried women
(ahiki na airetu) of the clan, who are singing, dancing and
jumping joyously, and at the same time tossing small
calabashes (thego) containing a special kind of gruel known
as kenage.1 The girl then takes sips from each calabash
held to her lips by the women. When this is finished the
girl is left to rest until the day of the great ceremonial
dance (matuumo).

The Great Ceremonial Dance (Matuumo)
The day before the physical operation is performed the
girl is called early in the morning to have her head shaved by
the sponsor. All her clothes are removed, she is given a
massage, after which her naked body is decked with beads
lent to her by women relatives and friends. About ten
o'clock in the morning relatives and friends gather at the
girl's homestead. Here a short ceremony of reunion with
the ancestors of the clan is performed, and a leader is chosen
to lead the procession to the homestead where the irua
is to take place.
The girl is provided with a bell (kegamba) which is tied
on her right leg just above the calf, or sometimes above the
knee, to provide the rhythm to the procession and also for
the dance. The girl is put in the middle of the procession,
which moves slowly, singing ritual songs until they reach
the irua's homestead, where the procession is joined by the
1

See Plate V (b).

Initiation of Boys and Girls

139

other initiates who are accompanied by other processions of
relatives and friends dressed in their best.
The matuumo ciances and songs begin at forenoon before
the sun is overhead and continue the whole day. It takes
place inside the homestead, but if the homestead is not
large enough it is held on some convenient site which must
be in close proximity to the homestead. The site is cleared
and carefully examined to make sure that there is nothing
on the ground that can hurt the feet of candidates while
dancing.
The ceremonial doctor (mondo-mogo wa mamburay goes
round the site sprinkling a brownish powder called rothuko
on the ground, to counteract any evil design which might
be directed against the candidates. This is followed by the
elders who sprinkle honey beer (njoohi ya ooke) on the
ground to appease the ancestral spirits and to bring them
into harmony with those of the living. When the elders
have completed their work of purifying the ground, the
initiates enter the ground accompanied by their sponsors,
relatives and friends, adorned with ceremonial dresses and
green leaves; then all of them begin to dance. The crowd
which has gathered for the great event forms a thick wall
round the arena'! While the dancing and singing is going
on a ceremonial horn is blown at intervals, and before it is
sounded, a little medicine (itwanda) is rubbed inside; this
medicine is believed to have power of chasing away evil
spirits and preventing them from doing harm to the
initiates.
Late in the afternoon an arch of banana trees and sugarcanes is built at the entrance of the homestead of the
matuumo. The arch is decorated with sacred flowers of
many shapes and colour; no unauthorised person may
1

See plate V (a).

Facing Mount Kenya
pass through the arch. The arch is considered as a medium
through which the ancestral spirits can be harmonised
with the irua and appeased, so as not to bring any misfortune on the ceremony in which the ceremonial council
offers sacrifices to the god Ngai.
When the decoration of the arch is finished the dance is
stopped. The irua candidates are lined up ready for the
sacrifice which marks the end of matuumo, This consists of
the boys running a race of about two miles to a sacred tree
called mogumo or motamayo, which they have to climb and
break top branches, while the girls gather round singing,
and at the same time gathering the leaves and the twigs
dropped by the boys.
To start the race a ceremonial horn is blown. At this
point the girls, who are not allowed to participate in the
race, start out walking to the tree, escorted by a group of
senior warriors and women singing ritual and heroic songs.
When the girls are near the tree, the ceremonial horn is
again sounded, this time indicating that it is time for the
boys to start the race. The boys then start running in a
great excitement, as though they were going to a battle.
The truth is, it is really considered a sort of fight between
the spirit of childhood and that of adulthood.
The crowd which has already gathered round the tree
await the arrival of the boys in order to judge the winner
of the race. They shout and cheer merrily as the excited
boys arrive, raising their wooden spears, ready to throw
them over the sacred tree. The significance of this ceremonial racing is the fact that it determines the leader of that
particular age-group.
The one who reaches the tree first
and throws his wooden spear over the tree is elected there
and then as the leader and the spokesman of the age-group
for life. It is believed that such a one is chosen by the will

Initiation of Boys and Girls

I41

of the ancestral spirits in communication with Ngai, and is
therefore highly respected.
The girl who arrives at the sacred tree first is also regarded
in the same way. She becomes the favourite, and all try
to win her affections with the hope of marrying her.
The mogumo ceremony occupies only a short time. As
stated above, the boys climb the tree, break the top branches,
while the girls collect leaves and twigs dropped on the
ground. These are later tied into bunches and carried back
to the homestead to keep the sacred fire burning the whole
night and also to be used in other rituals, especially in
making the initiates' beds. The songs rendered by the
relatives and friends round the foot of the tree generally
pertain to sexual knowledge. This is to give the initiates an
opportunity of acquainting themselves with all necessary
rules and regulations governing social relationship between
men and women.
At the completion of kuuna mogumo (breaking of the
sacred tree), the boys and girls are lined up according to
the order of their adoption. Here a ceremony of taking the
tribal oath (muma wa anake) is conducted by the elders of
the ceremonial council.
The initiates promise by this
oath that from this day onward they will in every respect
deport themselves like adults and take all responsibilities
in the welfare of the community, and that they will not lag
behind whenever called upon to perform any service or
duty in the protection and advancement of the tribe as a
whole. Furthermore, they are made to promise never to
reveal the tribal secrets, even to a member of the tribe who
has not yet been initiated.
At the conclusion of the oath ceremony a group of senior
warriors form at the head of the procession, followed by the
initiates. Then the crowd flanks both sides of the proces-

142

Facnig Mount Kenya

sion as a bodyguard.
They march slowly towards the
homestead of the matuumo, carrying the leaves and twigs
gathered from the sacred tree, mogumo. The initiates are
warned never to look behind as they move along, for to do
so would bring misfortune to them at the time of irua, and,
furthermore, the childhood misdeeds which they have
thrown over the sacred tree, mogumo, would come back to
them. The songs they sing on the homeward march are
directed towards denouncing all things that are not fit and
proper for any adult member of the community to do.
Moreover, the phrases embodied in these songs are to
encourage the initiates to become worthy and honourable
members of the adult community into which they are to be
graduated.
When they arrive at the homestead, a ceremony of parting
is performed, gotiihera ciana, that is, spraying the candidates
with honey dews. The ceremonial council forms a circle
in the courtyard;
the leader of the ceremonial council
holds a calabash containing honey juice mixed with milk,
and a special Gikuyu medicine called oomo, which is supposed to impart bravery or endurance. He takes a mouthful
of this liquid and, as the initiates pass through the arch, he
sprays them with it. An elderly woman follows and does
the same with another kind of liquid called gethambio. This
is done in order to protect the initiates against fear, bad
temptations and attacks of evil spirits.
While this is
going on, the initiates answer in unison: "Togotiherwo
rerea rea njoke twerirageria:" that is: "We have been
sprayed with the stings of the bees which we have been
longing for. We shall follow the wisdom and the energy of
the bees."
At the end of the ceremony the boys and girls are free to
go to their respective homes to rest until next morning.

Initiation of Boys and Girls

143

Care is taken to protect them from anything that might
inflict wounds upon them, as the shedding of blood is
regarded as an omen of ill-luck. The initiates are guarded
the whole night by senior warriors against outside interference. In every home a ceremonial doctor (mondo-mogo
wa mambura) is assigned by the traditional couneil (njama
ya kirera) to protect the initiates against any possible
attacks from witchcraft and also against any temptation
or enticement to indulge in sexual intercourse.

How the Girl is Operated on
Early in the morning of the day of the physical operation
the girl is called at cock-crow.
She is fed with a special
food (kemere kia oomo), eaten only on this occasion, after
which she is undressed, leaving only one string of beads
across her shoulder, known as mogathe wa mwenji (present
for the barber). This is given to her sponsor as a symbol
of lasting friendship and as a bond of mutual help in all
matters. It also signifies that henceforth the girl is supposed to hide nothing from her sponsor nor deny her
guardian anything demanded from her, even if it be the
last she possesses.
After all necessary arrangements have been made, the
girl is escorted to a place appointed for the meeting of all
the candidates. From there they are led to a special river
where they bathe. The boys are assigned to a particular
place while the girls bathe at a point below them, singing in
unison: "<Togwe-thamba na munja wa ecanake." which
means: "We have bathed with the cream of youth."
This is done before the sun rises, when the water is very
cold. They go up to their waist in the river, dipping
themselves to the breast, holding up the ceremonial leaves

144

Facing Mount Kenya

in their hands; then they begin shaking their wrists,
dropping the leaves into the river as a sign of drowning
their childhood behaviour and forgetting about it forever.
The initiates spend about half an hour in the river, in order
to numb their limbs and to prevent pain or loss of blood
at the time of operation. The sponsors superintend to see
that the initiates bathe in the correct manner, while the
mothers, relatives and friends are present, painted with red
and white ochre (therega na moonyo), singing ritual and
encouraging songs. The warriors keep guard to prevent
the spectators or strangers from coming too near to the
bank.
When the bathing is completed, all the initiates are lined
up following their order of adoption. The ceremonial
horn is blown to warn the passers-by that the initiates are
about to march and that the road must be cleared. No one
is allowed to pass across the appointed path, as this is
regarded as bad luck (molino). A small boy and a girl are
chosen, in accordance with what the Gikuyu believe to be a
lucky omen (nyoni-ya-monyaka, "lucky bird "). Their
duty is to carry branches of creepers, called mokengeria
and mwambalgoro, which is believed to have certain antiseptic and healing powers. The boy and the girl, with
their branches of creepers, stand at the entrance of the
homestead, in order to be the first to meet the initiates On
their arrival.
As the candidates approach, a special ceremonial horn is
sounded rhythmically. The initiates advance slowly
towards the homestead with both hands raised upwards,
elbows bent, pressed against their ribs, with the fists closed
and thumbs inserted between the first and second fingers,
kuuna thana. This signifies that they are ready to stand the
operation firmly and fearlessly.

Initiation of Boys and Girls

14S

Unlike the previous day the songs take on an entirely
different form. There is no more dancing and jumping.
The singing is of a mournful character, in slow and gentle
voices. This is a moment of great excitement and anxiety,
especially for the mother and father whose first-born is
to be initiated, for not only is their boy or girl passing from
childhood to adulthood, but the father and mother are to
be promoted to a higher status in the society. They all
join in singing songs of anxiety, " Twahirwoko tondo twagucithio motongoro?" which means: "Where are we led
to in this tedious procession?"
In the meanwhile the
elders select a place near the homestead where the operation
is to be performed. This place is called iteeri,
Here a clean cowhide, tanned and polished, is spread on
the ground;
the ceremonial leaves called mathakwa are
spread on the hide. The girls sits down on the hide, while
their female relatives and friends form a sort of circle,
several rows thick, around the girls, silently awaiting the
great moment. No mule is allowed to go near or even to
peep through this cordon.
Any man caught doing so
would be severely punished.'
Each of the girls sits down with her legs wide open on
the hide. Her sponsor sits behind her with her legs interwoven with those of the girl, so as to keep the girl's legs in
a steady, open position. The girl reclines gently against her
sponsor or motiiri, who holds her slightly on the shoulders
to prevent any bodily movement, the girl meanwhile staring
skywards. After this an elderly woman, attached to the
ceremonial council, comes in with very cold water, which
has been preserved through the night with a steel axe in it.
1 Because of this rule, the photographs (Plate V (c) and (d))
represent boys. But the girls' procedure is identical except for the
physical operation itself.

F acing Mount Kenya
This water is called mae maithanwa (axe water). The water
is thrown on the girl's sexual organ to make it numb and to
arrest profuse bleeding as well as to shock the girl's nerves
at the time, for she is not supposed to show any fear or
make any audible sign of emotion or even to blink. To do
so would be considered cowardice (kerogi) and make her
the butt of ridicule among her companions.
For this
reason she is expected to keep her eyes fixed upwards until
the operation is completed.
When this preparation is finished, a woman specialist,
known as moruithia, who has studied this form of surgery
from childhood, dashes out of the crowd, dressed in a very
peculiar way, with her face painted with white and black
ochre. This disguise tends to make her look rather terrifying, with her rhythmic movement accompanied by the
rattles tied to her legs. She takes out from her pocket
(mondo) the operating Gikuyu razor (rwenji), and in quick
movements, and with the dexterity of a Harley Street
surgeon, proceeds to operate upon the girls. With a
stroke she cuts off the tip of the clitoris (rong' otho). As no
other part of the girl's sexual organ is interfered with, this
completes the girl's operation.
Immediately the old
woman who originally threw the water on the girls comes
along with milk mixed with some herbs called mokengeria
and ndogamoki, which she sprinkles on the fresh wound
to reduce the pain and to check bleeding, and prevent
festering or blood poisoning.
In a moment each girl is
covered with a new dress (cloak) by her sponsor. At this
juncture the silence is broken and the crowd begins to sing
joyously in these words: "Ciana ciito ire kooma ee-ho,
nea marerire-ee-ho," which means: "Our children are
brave, ee-ho (hurrah). Did anyone cry? No one criedhurrah! "

Initiation of Boys and Girls

147

After this the sponsors hold the girls by the arms and
slowly walk to a special hut which has been prepared for the
girls. Here the girls are put to sleep on beds prepared on
the ground with sweet-smelling leaves called marerecwa,
mataathi and maturanguru. The two first mentioned are
used for keeping flies away or any other insect, and also
to purify the air and counteract any bad smell which may
be caused by the wounds, while the last-named is purely a
ceremonial herb. The leaves are changed almost daily by
the sponsors who are assigned to look after the needs of the
initiates (irui). For the first few days no visitors are allowed
to see the girls, and the sponsors take great care to see that
no unauthorised person approaches the hut. It is feared
that if someone with evil eyes (gethemengo) sees the girls it
will result in illness.

Healing of the Wound
At the time of the surgical operation the girl hardly feels
any pain for the simple reason that her limbs have been
numbed, and the operation is over before she is conscious
of it. It is only when she awakes after three or four hours
of rest that she begins to realise that something has been
done to her genital organ. The writer has learned this
fact from several girls (relatives and close friends) who
have gone through the initiation and who belong to the
same age-group with the writer.
When the girl wakes up the nurse who is in attendance
washes her with some kind of watery herb called mahoithia
(drainers or dryers).
After the washing the wound is
attended with antiseptic and healing leaves called Icagutwi
or matei (chasers or banishers).
The leaves are folded
together, about two inches long, half an inch wide and

Facing Mount Kenya
quarter of an inch thick; then they are dipped in oil
maguta ma mbariki (Gikuyu castor oil) to prevent them
sticking on the wound and also to prevent the wound from
shrinking.
The bandage is then placed on the wound
between libia majora to keep the two lips apart and prevent
them from being drawn together while the wound heals.
The girl sits down with her legs closed together so as to
keep the bandage in position.
Frequently the girl is
carefully examined by the nurse, and whenever she urinates,
the nurse is there ready to clean the wound and put on a new
bandage. The old bandage is hidden away to ensure that
no man shall cross over it or put his foot on it, for such an
act would bring misfortune to the man or to the girl.
For the first week after her initiation the girl is not
allowed to go for a walk or even to touch with her bare
hands anything in the way of food. The nurse puts the
girl's food on a banana leaf, called ngoto or icoya, which
serves as a plate. The leaf is lifted to the mouth without
the girl actually touching its contents with her hands.
The food eaten by the invalids is supplied by the parents,
relatives and friends. The initiates, both boys and girls,
eat collectively all food, irrespective of where it comes
from, for all contributions are kept in one place in charge of
the nurses and shared in common by the initiates, who
refer to one another as sisters and brothers. The invalids
are entertained by their sponsors, who sing them encouraging songs, in which they bring out vividly the experience
they gained after they were circumcised, that in a few days
tlieir wounds will heal and soon they will be able to go out
jumping and dancing. These songs have a great psychological effect on the minds of the initiates, for they strongly
believe that what has happened to their predecessors will
also happen to them. With this in view their thoughts

Initiation of Boys and Girls

I49

rest not on the operation, but on the day when they will
again appear in public as full-fledged members of the
community.
On the sixth day the sponsors make a full report to the
ceremonial council; if all initiates are well and can walk,
a ceremony of gotonyio or gociarwo (which means to be
entered or born) is arranged on the eighth day. If all are
not well the ceremony is postponed until the twelfth day,
for no ceremony would be arranged on the seventh, ninth
or eleventh day after apy event has taken place. Uneven
days are considered by the Gikuyu to be unlucky for
embarking on any important business.
On the day appointed the parents gather at the homestead
of the irua, bringing with them presents in the way of
beer (njohi or ooke), bananas and vegetables. The ceremony
consists of killing a selected sheep, the skin of which is cut
into ribbons (ngwaro) which are put on the wrists of the
boys and girls. The elder who has adopted the children
at the time of irua stands at one side of the entrance of his
wife's hut, while his wife stands on the other side facing
him. The rest of the elders with their wives stand in the
courtyard in two rows, facing one another. The children
are called to appear before the elders. As they pass through
between the two rows, the elders utter blessings and at the
same time touch them on the head with sacred leaves called
mataathi and maturanguru. At the entrance of the hut the
mother and father put the ngwaro on the wrists of the boys
and girls as they enter the hut. After the initiates have
entered the hut the mother and father follow them. The
two go to bed while the children remain seated. The door
(riige) is closed and silence is maintained, both by those
inside the hut and those outside. In a short moment the
mother begins to groan as though she were in great pain;
M

Facing Mount Kenya
the father gets up and opens the door quickly. He calls
out for mociarithla (a midwife), an elderly woman,
who comes in carrying the gut of the sheep which
has been killed. It is placed on a hide where the mother
is sitting. Another woman comes in and cuts the gut. At
this juncture the boy initiates emit a roar as of a lion,
gethamaro, and the girls join in applauding with Ngemi-ari-ri-ri-i-ri. After this the gut is cut in a long ribbon,
and while the initiates stand in one group close together
the ribbon encircles them, being tied so as to cover the
navel of those on the outside of the circle. They stand in
this position for a few minutes; then the midwife comes
along with a razor dipped in sheep's blood and cuts the
ribbon in two. This symbolises the cutting of the umbilical
cord at birth. This is done to express the rebirth of the
initiate. Another woman then comes carrying ceremonial
leaves (mathalcwa) sprinkled with blood, in which she
wraps the ribbon which has just been cut. This is similar
to the afterbirth, and is put on the mathakwa and carried
outside to be buried. When the woman appears outside, the
parents, who are still seated, give a round of applause,
saying: " Ciana irogea ohoro, thaai+ehathayai Ngai thaai "
-" Peace be with the children, peace-beseech
ye, Ngai
(God) peace."
After this the elder who has adopted the children comes
out with his wife, followed by the children. They form a
big circle round the fire on which the sheep's meat has been
roasted. An elder of the ceremonial council takes the chest
of the sheep which has been roasted (gethori) and stands
up facing Kere-Nyaga, with both hands held aloft. The elder
sings a hymn, offering prayers to Ngai. He tears pieces
from the meat with his teeth, spits them on the ground,
starting from north, east, south, west and ending north. He

Initiation of Boys and Girls

151

hands over the meat to the elder of the homestead and his
wife, who Eonow the same example. The two then, holding
the meat together, pass it round to each child, who tears
the meat in the same manner. The elder and his wife
address the children as: "My tribal son or daughter";
the
children answer: .. My tribal father or my tribal mother."
The words used are: Father to son: " TPanyu-Baba;"
son to father:" Wanyu-Baba." Mother to son:" Wakiawa/'
son to mother: "Wakiamaito."
Mother to daughter:
" Wakeri i" daughter to mother: "TFakeri." Father to
daughter: " Wa-kia-mwari;"
daughter to father: " Wakia-Baba:"
This signifies that the children have now been born again,
not as the children of an individual, but of the whole tribe.
The initiates address one another as "Wanyu- Wakine,"
which means" My tribal brother or sister." When the
ceremony is completed all burst into ritual song. They bid
farewell to one another and then leave the homestead under
the escort of their relatives. On the arrival at their respective homes a sheep or goat is killed by the parents to
welcome them home again and anoint them as new members
of the community (koinokai na kohaka mwanake or moiretu
maguta). At this ceremony the parents are provided with
brass ear-rings, as a sign of seniority. This is done when
the first-born is initiated.
For a period of three or four months, according to the
rules of various clans, the initiates do not participate in
any work. They devote most of their time to going around
the district singing the initiates' song called waine. In this
several groups take part. The song takes place in the field
and is performed only in daytime. The initiates stand in a
big circle holding several sticks (micee) in their hands. A
bunch of micee is held in the left hand while one stick is

Facing A1ount Kenya
held in the right hand. In this manner the initiates beat the
micee according to the rhythm of the song. The inner circle
is kept clear for the favourites from various groups-namely
those who were the first to reach the sacred tree. They
enter the circle two by two, a boy and a girl. As they
appear in the arena the sticks are beaten rhythmically by
all, whilst at the same time they utter compliments. These
meetings afford the initiated boys and girls opportunities
of coming into contact with and knowing one another
intimately.
At the end of the holiday period, a day is fixed for the
initiates to return to the homestead where the irua took
place. Here the final ceremony of cleansing or purification
is performed. This is called menjo or gotltiga. Up to this
time the initiates have been regarded as children (ciana)
or new-comers (ciumeri), and, as such, they cannot hold any
responsibility in the community, for they are in their
transitional period. Neither juvenile nor adult laws can
be applied to them, and thus they form a sort of free
co mmunity of " merry-go-round."
On the day appointed for the ceremony, people gather
from far and near to join in the festival dance in which the
" new-comers"
are introduced into the community.
The ceremony consists of shaving the heads (kwenja) of
the boys and girls. The clothes and ornaments worn during
the transitional period are discarded;
their bodies are
painted with red ochre mixed with oil, after which they are
dressed in new clothes.
The boys are provided with
warriors' equipment;
the girls are adorned with beads,
armlets and other adornments.
Then they are led to the
dance, where they are introduced to the assembly as fuIlfledged members of the community.
While the dance is
going on, mothers and fathers partake of a feast of beer-

Initiation of Boys and Girls

153

drinking (njohi), which usually takes place during all
solemn functions.
The wound normally requires a week to heal, but, of
course, there are some cases which take longer, generally due
to negligence on the part of the girl or the nurse in applying
the healing leaves in the proper way. Such cases are few,
but result in a septic condition, and the formation of much
scar tissue on the area of the labia majora, which may make
childbirth difficult. Cases of this nature sometimes find
their way to hospitals and attract the attention of both the
missionary and official doctors, who then and there, without
careful investigation of the system of female circumcision,
attack the custom of clitoridectomy in general, asserting
that it is barbaric and a menace to the life of the mothers.
To strengthen their attacks on this custom, these" wellwishers" have gone so far as to state that almost every first
child dies as a result of this operation at the time of initiation, and that the operation is more severe to-day than it
was formerly.
Irresponsible statements of this kind are
not to be taken too seriously, for it must not be forgotten
that very few of the normal cases of childbirth ever come to
the notice of European doctors. The theory that " every
first child dies as a result of the operation" has no foundation at all. There are hundreds of first-born children among
the Gikuyu who are still living, and the writer is one of them.
The missionaries who attack the irua of girls are more
to be pitied than condemned, for most of their information
is derived from Gikuyu converts who have been taught by
these same Christians to regard the custom of female
circumcision as something savage, and barbaric, worthy
only of heathens who live in perpetual sin under the
influence of the Devil. Because of this prejudiced attitude,
the missionaries are at a disadvantage in knowing the true

Facing Mount Kenya
state of affairs. Even the few scientifically minded ones
are themselves so obsessed with prejudice against the custom
that their objectivity is blurred in trying to unravel the
mystery of the irua.
With such limited knowledge as they are able to acquire
from their converts or from others, who invariably distort
the reality of the irua in order to please them, these same
missionaries pose as authorities on African customs. How
often have we not heard such people saying: "We have
lived in Africa for a number of years and we know the
African mind well?"
This, however, does not qualify
them or entitle them to claim authority on sociological or
anthropological questions.
The African is in the best
position properly to discuss and disclose the psychological
background of tribal customs, such as irua, etc., and he
should be given the opportunity to acquire the scientific
training which will enable him to do so. This is a point
which should be appreciated by well-meaning anthropologists who have had experience of the difficulties of
field-work in various parts of the world.

Sex Life among Young People
HE physical operation

on the genital organs of
both sexes is regarded as a starting-point
for
various activities in the tribal organisation.
It
signifies that the individual operated upon has been given,
during the course of the pre-initiation ceremonial dances
and songs, all the essential information on the laws and
customs of the tribe.
Among the things taught during this period are the
matters relating to rules and regulations governing sexual
indulgence. In order not to suppress entirely the normal
sex instinct, the boys and girls are told that in order to
keep good health they must acquire the technique of practising a certain restricted form of intercourse, called ombani na
ngwelco (platonic love and fondling). This form of intimate
contact between young people is considered right and
proper and the very foundation stone upon which to build
a race morally, physically and mentally sound.
For it
safeguards the youth from nervous and psychic maladjustments.
The social life of Gikuyu youths covers a wide field of
activities. They organise numerous night and day dances
for recreation and enjoyment. At these socials young men

T

I55

Facing Mount Kenya
and women mix freely. It is generally at these social
gatherings that friendship begins. A young man may
attract the attention of a young girl, or girls, by his appearance, his smartness in dancing or dressing his hair, or by his
charming and graceful carriage. Similarly a young girl
may attract the attention of a young man, or men. The
man who has several girl friends is known as getharia or
keombani (heart-breaker).
A Beau Brummel may attract
as many as forty girls. A girl may win the admiration of
several young men, but they would have to compete for
her. The word ngweko (fondling) is used in its real Gikuyu
sense and not as the loose term ngweko ya gecomba, employed
by missionaries and detribalised Gikuyu, which means full
sexual intercourse.
In a dance a getharia can easily be recognised, for he
dances with several girls around him, but in order that he
will not have a monopoly, a kind of Gikuyu " Paul Jones"
dance, gothambacana, is repeated very often so as to allow
the less attractive young men an opportunity of dancing
with nice girls. Girls visit their boy-friends frequently,
especially during the dancing seasons. The boys also visit
the girls in their homes and take them to dances and escort
them home afterwards.
Ngweko, or fondling, is looked upon as a sacred act and
one which must be done in a systematic, well-organised
manner. The Gikuyu do not kiss girls on the lips as
Europeans do; therefore, ngweko takes the place of lip
kissing, but, unlike the Europeans, who are fond of kissing
in public places, the Gikuyu consider such public display
of affection vulgar. All matters relating to sex are done
according to a well-regulated code of convention.

Sexual Life

1)7

How Ngweko is Organised
The girls visit their boy-friends at a special hut, thingira,
used as a rendezvous by the young men and women. They
bring with them their favourite food and drinks as a token
of affection. These are shared among the age-group in the
thingira, who eat their food collectively. No boy can eat
or drink by himself what has been brought to him by his
sweetheart;
such an act would be severely punished.
In this way the boys who have no girl-friends are included
in all entertainment, because the good-looking young man
of the age-group does not act for himself; his popularity
is considered the popularity of the group as a whole, and
his girl-friends are also regarded as friends of the members
of the age-group.
So no matter how ugly a boy may be,
his ugliness is compensated for by the more attractive
members of his age-group. There is a saying in Gikuyu :
"Mogekumia
thaka, kumagiai ndoti ya riika ee hinya.
Riika retire gacii "-(When
ye praise the handsome man,
first praise an. ugly and strong man of the age-group.
There is no small or despised inferior man in the agegroup).
Girls may visit the thingira at any time, day or night.
After eating, while engaged in conversation with the boys,
one of the boys turns the talk dramatically to the subject of
ngweko. If there are more boys than girls, the girls are
asked to select (lcuoha nyelci) whom they want to have as their
companion. The selection is done in the most liberal way.
The language used is either in proverbs or indirectly as,
for instance, the phrase" Kuoha nyelci ~'-to tie the grasswhich is equivalent to " Choose your partner." In such a
case it is not necessary for the girls to select their own
intimate friends, as this would be considered selfish and

Facing M aunt Kenya
unsociable. Of course, this does not mean that the girls
do not sometimes have ngweko with those whom they are
specially fond of, but generally they follow the rules of
exchanging partners. The same freedom of social contact
exists even among married people and for this reason
youths are encouraged to cultivate the spirit of comradeship
and group solidarity before marriage.
After the partners have been arranged, one of the boys
gets up, saying: "Ndathie kwenogora" (I am going to
stretch myseIf). His girl partner follows him to the bed.
The boy removes all his clothing. The girl removes her
upper garment, nguoya ngoro, and retains her skirt, mothuru,
and her soft leather apron, mwengo, which she pulls back
between her legs and tucks in together with her leather
skirt, mothuru.
The two v-shaped tails of her mothuru
are pulled forward between her legs from behind and
fastened to the waist, thus keeping mwengo in position and
forming an effective protection of her private parts. In
this position the lovers lie together facing each other,
with their legs interwoven to prevent any movement of
their hips. They then begin to fondle each other, rubbing
their breasts together, whilst at the same time they engage
in love-making conversation until they gradually fall
asleep. Sometimes the partners experience sexual relief,
but this is not an essential feature of the ngweko.
The chief concern in this relationship is the enjoyment
of the warmth of the breast, orugare wa nyondo, and not the
full experience of sexual intercourse.
It has been said several times by Europeans, especially
missionaries, that it is unbelievable that a young man and a
young woman could sleep in one room, let alone in one
bed, without copulating. Many Gikuyu have been punished
and regarded as "sinners"
by missionaries simply for

Sexual

Life

159

having been found sleeping in the same room with a girl,
for in their eyes such an act is sinful.
The Gikuyu who have not been brought up under the
missionaries' influence find it difficult to understand "this
sort of European puritanism, for a Gikuyu man has been
taught from childhood to develop the technique of selfcontrol in the matter of sex, which enables him to sleep in
the same bed with a girl without necessarily having sexual
intercourse;
while the missionaries' idea is, that since a
white man would not be able to restrain himself under
similar circumstances, so the African would not be able to,
and so must be forbidden to sleep with a woman-friend in
the Gikuyu fashion.

The Rules Governing Ngweko
The tribal law prohibits a young man from pulling out a
girl's garment (kogucia mwengo wa moiretu] while having
ngweko, He must put his sexual organ between his thighs
so as to prevent touching the girl with it. The custom also
prevents a girl from touching the male sexual organ with
her hands. Of course, it sometimes happens that in the
case of a long-standing friendship a girl may allow a boy
to put his sexual organ between her thighs- and hold it
tight in that position without penetrating;
or by mutual
arrangement a girl may allow her lover to have fuller
intercourse, trusting that incomplete penetration would
safeguard against the risk of conception.
But such
behaviour is absolutely against the tribal law and never
takes place between casual lovers. If it does happen,
which is rare, the law punishes it by imposing social stigma
upon the offenders. Neither the man nor the girl can sleep
with the back turned against the partner. The girl may not

160

Facing Mount Kenya

lie on top of the boy or across him (gotagarara); to do so,
or to touch the man's penis, is" unclean" (mogiro or thahu),
and both must be purified by a mondo-mogo (purifier).
The girl is expected to be a virgin in the sense of having
an unperforated hymenal membrane when she marries. Any
intercourse which may result in pregnancy before marriage
is strictly forbidden. Any young man who may render a
girl pregnant (kohira moiretu ihu) is severely punished by
the kiama (tribal council). The fine for this is nine sheep
or goats and three big, fat sheep (ndorome) as the kiama
fees. Besides this, the man is made a social outcast or
" sent to Coventry" (kohingwo) by all the young men and
girls of his own age-group.
Punishment is also extended
to the girl. She pays a fine by providing a feast to the men
and the girls of her age-group. She is also liable to ridicule
(kohingwo and gocamhio).
If a man is detected by a girl trying to loosen her garments
during the night of ngweko she generally reports the matter
to all her friends in the district. The matter is taken to the
age-group meeting (getongano kia riika). Such a man would
be ostracised by his friends and would be debarred from
having ngweko with other girls, as they would not trust or
have confidence in him. These guiding principles, ingrained
in the very souls of the young men and women, serve as
checks to sexual promiscuity, for, unless a man knows a
girl very well, he would not run the risk of suggesting
copulation to her lest she should not only refuse, but tell
other girls and have him 1cohingwo(" sent to Coventry").

Sexual Tahoos
Between members of the same family all forms of erotic
connection are considered a great sin. Although there is

Sexual Life
great freedom among young people in their courtship and
amorous experiments, brothers and sisters would not dare
to indulge in these activities in one another's presence.
In bachelor huts, where young people meet freely, brother
and sister cannot be present together at the same time,
except on purely social occasions when there is no sex-play.
For example, if a brother knows that his sister has a lover
in a particular bachelor-hut, he makes a point of not visiting
the hut during the times when she is frequenting it. The
same thing applies to the sister. This rule is also observed
in dances and other ceremonies. No brother could take
his sister, or any close female relative, as a partner on such
occasions.
During festival dances, where people from
various districts meet and dance together, it is not always
possible to recognise a relative who comes from far away,
and a man may sometimes be seen dancing with his cousin
by mistake. When this happens, people who know will
start laughing and joking to warn the young man of his
error. At once the two separate and find other partners,
and sometimes a present is given to the girl by way of
apology from the man.
All sexual familiarity between parents and their children
is strictly forbidden.
This applies to all children of the
members of one's own age-grade, and breach of this rule is
considered a great crime. This, of course, does not restrict
parents .frorn teaching their children about sex. During
early childhood parents talk freely to their children,
explaining all matters connected with sexual taboos.
In the Gikuyu community any form of sexual intercourse
other than the natural form, between men and women
acting in a normal way, is out of the question. It is considered taboo even to have sexual intercourse with a
woman in any position except the regular one, face to face.

162

Facing Mount Kenya

Before initiation it is considered right and proper for
boys to practise masturbation as a preparatidh for their
future sexual activities.
Sometimes two or more boys
compete in this, to see which can show himself more active
than the rest. This practice takes place outside the homestead, under a tree or bush, where the boys are not visible
to their elders. It is considered an indecency to be seen
doing it, except by boys of the same age-grade.
The
practice is given up after the initiation ceremony, and
anyone seen doing it after that would be looked upon as
clinging to a babyish habit, and be laughed at, because
owing to the free sex-play which is permitted among young
people, there is now no need to indulge in it.
Masturbation among girls is considered wrong, and if a
girl is seen by her mother even so much as touching that
part of her body she is at once told that she is doing wrong.
It may be said that this, among other reasons, is probably
the motive of trimming the clitoris, to prevent girls from
developing sexual feelings around that point.
Owing to these restrictions, the practice of homosexuality
is unknown among the Gikuyu. The freedom of intercourse
allowed between young people of opposite sex makes it
unnecessary, and encourages them to acquire experience
which will be useful in married life.

CHAPTER

VIII

Marriage System

I

Nthe Gikuyu community marriage and its obligations
occupy a position of great importance.
One of the
outstanding features in the Gikuyu system of marriage
is the desire of every member of the tribe to build up his
own family group, and by this means to extend and prolong
his father's mbari (clan). This results in the strengthening
of the tribe as a whole.
We may mention here that the Gikuyu system of courtship is based on mutual love and gratification of sexual
instinct between two individuals. And, therefore, a family
is constituted by a permanent union between one man and
one woman or several women.
Through the marriage
ceremony a man acquires sole right to sexual intercourse
with the woman or women whom he marries. On signing
the matrimonial contract the marriage ceases to be merely
a personal matter, for the contract binds not only the bride
and bridegroom, but also their kinsfolk. It becomes a duty
to produce children, and sexual intercourse between a man
and his wife or wives is looked upon as an act of production
and not merely as the gratification of a bodily desire.
The Gikuyu tribal custom requires that a married couple
should have at least four children, two male and two female.
163

Facing Mount Kenya
The first male is regarded as perpetuating the existence of
the man's father, the second as perpetuating that of the
woman's father. The first and second female children fulfil
the same ritual duty to the souls of their grandmothers on
both sides. The children are given names of the persons
whose souls they represent.
The desire to have children is deep-rooted in the hearts
of both man and woman, and on entering into matrimonial
union they regard the procreation of children as their first
and most sacred duty. A childless marriage in a Gikuyu
community is practically a failure, for children bring joy
not only to their parents, but to the mbari (clan) as a whole.
In Gikuyu society the rearing of a family brings with it a
rise in social status. The social position of a married man
and woman who have children is of greater importance and
dignity than that of a bachelor or spinster. After the birth of
the first child the married pair become the object of higher
regard on the part of their fellows than they were before.
Marriage is one of the most powerful means of maintaining the cohesion of Gikuyu society and of enforcing that
conformity to the kinship system and to tribal organisation
without which social life is impossible.
The most interesting feature in the Gikuyu marriage
system is the way in which marriages are solernnised, for the
validity of marriage and the social position of women in
the community
is determined by the fulfilment of
communal duties regulated by the marriage custom. We
will give here a full description of the Gikuyu marriage
ceremonies as they are performed to-day.
There has been some confusion in the minds of many
writers who have tried to explain the system of marriage
and the position of women in the African community.
Some, especially missionaries, have gone so far as to say that

Marriage System
African women are regarded as mere chattels of the men.
Well-informed anthropologists agree that this is erroneous
and a misconception of the African's social custom. From
the following account of the institution of marriage among
the Gikuyu, the reader may judge further as to whether
" purchase" is or is not a feature of the Gikuyu marriage
system.
Choice of Mates
In the Gikuyu community boys and girls are left free to
choose their mates, without any interference on the part of
the parents on either side. From earliest infancy there is
close social intercourse between the sexes, which provides
them with an opportunity of becoming acquainted with one
another for a considerable time before courtship begins.
Thus, hasty judgment in choosing one's husband or wife
is almost out of the question.

First Stage
When a boy falls in love with a girl he cannot tell her
directly that he loves her or display his devotion to her in
public, as this would be regarded by the Gikuyu as impolite
and uncultured. He therefore discusses the matter with one
or two of his best friends in the age-group to which he
belongs. They then all pay a visit to the girl's home. On
their arrival at the girl's homestead they enter her mother's
hut. The girl and her mother exchange greetings with
them. The mother then offers them refreshment and immediately goes away. Now the boys and the girl are left
alone. At this stage the conversation may start in the
following manner:
One of the boys addresses the girl:
N

166

Facing Mount Kenya

"Mware wa Njuguna?" (Daughter of Njuguna), "Wouldn't
you like to ask us why we have come here to-night?"
The girl answers: "No, it is not necessary to ask you
that. Gikuyu custom provides that anyone passing by can
come and have a meal with us."
The boy: "That is right, Mware wa Njuguna, but we are
looking for a homestead where we could be adopted and
be given tood and shelter not only when we are passing by,
but as children of the homestead."
At this remark the girl at once knows their object, and
she asks them to state definitely which one of them is looking
for the adoption. The boy then points out his friend who
is in love with the girl. If she accepts him as her future
husband she tells them to go away and come back some
other time. Sometimes two or three visits of this kind are
made. When she gives her final answer, she says to them:
" I am willing that the son of So-and-so should be adopted
into our homestead, but the ceremonial side of it is a matter
for my parents. You had better talk to them about it
yourselves."
If she does not accept him, she says: "Our house is not
big enough to adopt anyone at present," and they go away.

Second Stage
If accepted, her lover goes home and reports the matter
to his parents. They then prepare honey or sugar-cane beer,
which they take to the girl's parents. It is carried in two
calabashes, one big and the other small. This beer is known
as njohi ya njoorio, i.e. "The beer of asking the girl's hand."
When the parents of the two parties meet, the first thing the
girl's parents do is to provide the visitors with food before
they go into the question of matrimony. After this they

Marriage System
state the object of their visit, but most of the conversation
regarding their future son- or daughter-in-law is carried on
in proverbs. The girl is called and, after being introduced,
she is asked if she has agreed to become engaged, As she
cannot answer directly yes or no, a little ceremony is
necessary. Therefore, she is asked gently to fetch a particu ..
lar horn used for beer-drinking;
then to fill it with beer
and hand it to her father who, after sipping a little and
spitting it out, sprinkles some on his chest. He then hands
it over to his wife who does the same. The horn is filled
a second time and is handed to the boy's parents who
repeat the same procedure. In each case the girl takes a sip
first as a sign of consent.
If the lover has been refused he reports to his parents
who, if they would like their son to marry the girl, may
visit the girl's parents. The same ceremony takes place,
but if the girl disapproves of it she will not pour out the beer
or take the first sip. The visiting parents then go away.
When the parents' initial ceremony is concluded and the
girl is willing to be engaged, close friends are invited and
the beer is shared among them. At the conclusion of this
friendly gathering they all join in a prayer, korathimithia,
uttering blessings for the future unity and progress of the
two families.

Third Stage
When the boy's parents return home they begin to collect
sheep and goats, or cattle if they are rich, for the first
instalment of the dowry, roracio , these would be taken by
the lover to the girl's homestead and led to the hut of the
girl's mother. This visit is followed by another in which
some beer is brought, and the girl is consulted as in the

168

F acing Mount Kenya

first VISit. This beer is called njohi ya gothugumitheria
mbori, i.e. the beer for blessing the roracio sheep and goats.
This instalment is followed by another in a few days, and so
on until the number of animals amounts to about thirty or
forty. Beer is not necessarily brought each time. Even if a
man is rich it is considered ill-luck to bring all the roracio
at once. When, according to the custom of the clan, the
amount required for sealing the engagement has been sent,
a day is fixed for the actual engagement ceremony, called
ngurario, i.e. pouring out the blood of unity. In this all
the relatives are called to the girl's homestead, where a
sumptuous feast is provided, which includes the slaughtering of one fat sheep (ngoima ya ngurario) which has been
sent from the boy's homestead specially for this purpose.
The significance of this ceremony is in the first place to
announce publicly that the girl is engaged; secondly, to
provide the relatives on both sides with an opportunity of
meeting and getting to know one another; and, thirdly,
to decide on how much the roracio should be. The amount
varies from one clan to another and from district to district,
although the amount required by the Gikuyu law is thirty
sheep and goats. Sometimes, however, it runs to between
thirty and eighty sheep and goats, apart from numerous
presents exchanged on both sides. When a cow is included
in the roracio it is valued at ten sheep and goats, while an
ox is valued at five sheep and goats.
The main feature of this ceremony consists in the
killing of a fat sheep kept for this purpose. The sheep must
be of a certain colour-black,
white or brown-in
keeping
with the symbolism adhered to for ritual purposes by the
particular clan concerned. The blood is sprinkled along the
gateway and towards Mount" Kenya (Kere-Nyaga);
the
contents of the stomach are also sprinkled in the same way,

Marriage System
and also on the sheep and goats or cattle which have been
brought in for the roracio. This signifies that they are now
purified and protected from any evils, and that the boy's
parents have presented them to the girl's parents as a sign
of good faith. From this time on the interests of the two
clans are closely linked.

Fourth Stage
After all the arrangements are made in regard to roracio,
the maturity of the girl is discussed. The boy's parents say
to the girl's parents: "Is your daughter grown-up? "meaning: "Has she menstruated yet?"
At the end of the
discussion a final day is fixed on which to sign the marriage
contract. On the day in question all representatives of the
two clans and friends are invited. They bring with them
plenty of food and drink for the feast. The ceremony,
which is called gothenja ngoima, consists of slaughtering
six fat sheep, and in case of a rich man, an ox and five sheep.
In doing this the girl's consent must be obtained. She is
asked to provide the knife for skinning the sheep and to
take a leading part in slaughtering the first animal. The
kidneys of the first sheep are roasted and served to the
bride-to-be, who eats them, indicating in this way that
the engagement still holds good and that the families can
proceed with the formality of signing the marriage contract.
When this is done, the people assemble and take part in
the feast. This is followed by a big dance and the singing
of songs. The boy, with his age-group, comes in procession, carrying special presents for the girl's mother and for
the members of her clan. Any property, such as an axe,
basket or large leather strap, which the girl may have lost
as a child, will be made up to her parents by these presents.

Facing Mount Kenya
At about sunset, after the casual visitors have gone, the
women representatives of the clan are called into the yard
where baskets are kept containing their presents. These
presents are contributed by one of the elders, while the
womenfolk cheer every recipient with great excitement.
This is followed by a dance and song, called getiro, for
women only, which marks the end of the ngoima ceremony.
If the boy's homestead is in the neighbourhood, a short
visit is paid by a group of women, taking with them
presents for the boy's relatives, but if the homestead is far
away the visit is left to a later date. From this time onward
the girl is regarded as having been blessed and given away
to the boy's clan by her parents in agreement with the whole
clan. She can now go and weed gardens with the boy's
mother and other relatives in company with her girlfriends. The function of the ngoima ceremony is to furnish
a public wedding celebration in which all marriage agreements are concluded and in which the girl is betrothed t6
her fiance, not only by her parents, but by the representative
body of the clan acting collectively. She can now be taken'
to the boy's home as his wife at any time, without any
further ceremony being performed at her parents' homestead.

Wedding Day
When the boy has provided himself with a hut and made
the necessary preparation for housekeeping, he approaches
his parents, especially his mother, and asks them to arrange
a special day suitable for bringing his wife home. The
arrangement is made according to certain propitious days
of the moon, in accordance with the clan's history and
traditions.
For instance, many clans may not hold any
wedding between the old and new moon, since this

Marriage System

171

period is regarded as a " dark period" (mweri we nduma).
The period preferable for embarking on any important
project is the interval between the new moon and the full
moon.
A Gikuyu wedding is a thing which baffles many outsiders and terrifies many Europeans who may have an
opportunity of witnessing the events. This wedding drama
misleads foreign onlookers, who do not understand the
Gikuyu custom, into thinking that the girls are forced to
marry, and even that they are treated as chattels.
In response to the boy's request, the family meets in
council; the day is fixed for the wedding and kept secret
from the girl-thus
adding a dramatic touch to the proceedings. On the wedding day the boy's female relatives set
out to watch the girl's movements.
She might be in a
garden, weeding, or in a forest collecting firewood, etc.
When they have obtained the necessary information as to
where she is working they search for her. On finding her
they return with her, carrying her shoulder-high.
This is a
moment of real theatrical acting. The girl struggles and
refuses to go with them, protesting loudly and even seeming
to shed tears, while the women giggle joyously and cheer
her with songs and dances. The cries and cheers can be
heard for miles around, and the Gikuyu people will know
that the son of So-and-so has taken the daughter of So-andso in marriage-while
foreigners may imagine that the
girl has been forcibly seized. It is probable that any person
who is not well acquainted with the Gikuyu customs may
easily mistake the drama for reality.
In some cases, where the families are large, a counterfeit fight is staged between the women of both sides. This
provides great entertainment for the women and is followed
by a liberal feast at the bridegroom's homestead. The

Facing Mount Kenya
girl's cries, which are uttered theatrically in a singing
manner, include such phrases as: "I do not want to get
married! I will kill myself if you take me away from my
parents! Oh! How foolish I was to leave my home alone
and put myself into the hands of merciless people! Where
are my relatives? Cannot they come and release me and
prevent my being taken to a man whom I do not love? ..
and so on. This goes on until the girl reaches the boy's
homestead, where she is led into her new hut, while children
greet her, singing praises for their new bride. On her way
home the bride is cheered by passers-by, who utter blessings
for the bride and bridegroom and for their future homestead.
After the bride is comfortably settled in her new hut, the
whole party of women from both clans, who a short while
ago were engaged in a mock fight, join together and start
dancing, singing and cheering hilariously. In the evening
the bride is visited by her age-group of both sexes, who
bring presents in way of food and ornaments. The bride
entertains them with songs called !cerero, i.e. "weeping,"
in which girls only take part while the boys listen. The
kerero songs are mostly connected with the collective
activities of the girl's age-group, and the part played by the
girl. It is considered as the age-group mourning for the
loss of the services and companionship of one of their
number who, by marriage, has passed to another age-group.
The mourning songs are continued for eight days, during
which time the bride is frequently visited by her friends and
age-group of both sexes.
During this period the bride may not go out publicly or
do any work. She has a special back path which she may
use when she leaves the hut during the day to sit under a
tree for fresh air. Her girl-friends keep her company,
together with the children of the family. The kerero goes

on the whole day and a part of the evening, except for a few
intervals between the arrival and departure of the visitors.
About ten o'clock in the evening the bride and bridegroom
are left to themselves until the neighbourhood of nine
o'clock next morning, when the visitors begin to pour
In.

The question of physical virginity (as stated in the
chapter dealing with the female circumcision) is very
important, and parents expect their daughters to go to their
husbands as physical virgins. This must be reported to the
parents of both sides. The boy has to show by certain signs
that the girl was a virgin; the girl, too, has to do the same
to show that the boy is physically fit to be a husband. "In
case of impotency on either side, the matter is put before
the families' council and the marriage is annulled at once.
On the eighth day, when the kerero ceases, a sheep is
killed, the fat of which is fried and the oil is used to anoint
the bride in a ceremony of adoption into the new clan.
After she has been admitted as a full member of the
husband's family, she is free to mingle with its members
and take an active part in the general work of the homestead. When the adoption ceremony is concluded, a day is
fixed immediately for her to pay a visit to her own parents.
Care is taken in appointing the day, for she must not
travel or cook during her menstrual period.
On this
particular visit she carries a small calabash with beer in it
for the use of her parents in blessing her. On her way she
is led by a small girl, who goes before her holding one end
of a stick, the other end of which is held by the bride,
who follows as though she were blind. She is supposed to
be unable to see, and may not speak with any stranger she
may meet during her journey. She goes all the way with
bent head, hiding her face shyly, especially when somebody

174

Facing Mount Kenya

passes by her. She returns hack in the evening (if the
parents are in the neighbourhood) with presents from her
parents. Sometimes when parents are rich she is given two
or three sheep or goats. Her father-in-law also gives her
presents; these vary in some cases from five sheep and goats
to ten or a cow and a piece of fertile land. These presents
are regarded as an act of " warming" the bride's hut, and
they end the marriage ceremonial.

The Gikuyu System of Polygamy
The Gikuyu customary law of marriage provides that a
man may have as many wives as he can support, and that
the larger one's family the better it is for him and the tribe.
The love of children is also an encouraging factor of desiring
to have more than one wife. The custom also provides that
all women must be under the protection of men; and that
in order to avoid prostitution (no word exists for" prostitution" in the Gikuyu language) all women must be
married in their 'teens, i.e. fifteen to twenty. Thus there
is no term in the Gikuyu language for " unmarried" or
" old maids."
Before the advent of the white man the institution of
serfdom and wage-workers was unknown to the Gikuyu
people. The tribal customary law recognised the freedom
and independence of every member of the tribe.
At the
same time all were bound up together socially, politically,
economically,
and religiously by a system of collective
,
activities and mutual help, extending from the family group
to the tribe. The Weltanschauung of Gikuyu people is :
" L~anyagatuune
z>
ne mwamo k anero " (" G·rve an d ta k")
e .
For economic and political reasons every family Was
expected to be able to protect its own interests and at the

Marriage System

175

same time help to protect the common interests of the tribe
from outside attack. To do this effectively and to command
the respect of the tribe, it was necessary for every family
to have a number of male children who could be called up
for military services in time of crises and alien aggression.
It was also necessary to have a number of female children
who could also render assistance by cultivating the land
and looking after the general welfare of the tribe while the
men were fighting to defend their homesteads.
Furthermore, the society cannot do without them, for they are the
salt of the earth, they have the most sacred duty of creating
and rearing future generations.
Female children are
therefore looked upon as the connecting-link between
one generation and another and one clan and another,
through marriage, which binds the interests of clans close
together and makes them share in common the responsibilities of family life. For this reason, say the Gikuyu :
" Keimba kea mothoni na mothoni igoaga hamwe " (literally,
"Corpses
of relations-in-law fall together "), meaning
"Together
let us live and if need be together let
us die."
There is a fundamental idea among the Gikuyu that the
larger the family is the happier it will be. In Gikuyu the
qualification for a status to hold a high office in the tribal
organisation is based on family and not on property as is the
case in European society. It is held that if a man can
control and manage effectively the affairs of a large family,
this is an excellent testimonial of his capacity to look
after the interests of the tribe whom he will also treat with
fatherly love and affection as though it were all part of his
own family. Thus the saying: " Weega uumaga na mode"
(" A good leader begins in his own homestead ").
After a man has had the first wife, nyakiambi, a year or

Facing Mount Kenya
so generally passes, and then his wife starts to question him
about getting a second wife, especially if she is expecting a
child or immediately after she has had one. "My husband,
don't you think it is wise for you to get me a companion?
(moiru). Look at our position now. I am sure you will
realise how God has been good to us to gi~e us a nice and
healthy baby. For the first few days I must devote all my
attention to nursing our baby. I am weak .•. I can't go to
the river to bring water nor to the field to bring some food,
nor to weed our gardens. You have no one to cook for
you. When strangers come you have no one to entertain
them. I have no doubt that you realise the seriousness of
the matter. What do you think of the daughter of So-andso? She is beautiful and industrious and people speak
highly about her and her family. Do not fail me, my
husband. Try and win her love. I have spoken to her
and found that she is very interested in our homestead.
In anything that I can do to help you I am at your service,
my husband.
" Even if we have not enough sheep and goats for the
dowry our relatives and friends will help you so that you
can get her into our family. You are young and healthy
and this is the best time for us to have healthy children and
so enlarge our family group, and thereby perpetuate our
family name after you and I have gone. My husband
please act quickly as you know the Gikuyu saying: ' Mae
megotherera matletagerera mondo onyotie' (' The flowing
water of the river does not wait for a thirsty man ')."
The husband, following his wife's advice, starts to act.
He approaches his parents, and after consultation with them,
arrangements are made to visit the girl and her parents. If
accepted, he proceeds to pay the dowry and other gifts
connected with marriages.
When all arrangements are

Marriage System

177

completed, he builds a hut next to that of the first wife and
then brings the second wife home.
If the family in question is prosperous, after some time
another companion is sought, and so the number of wives
increase from one to fifty, and sometimes more. There is
no limit. of course, this does not mean that every Gikuyu
man has many wives. There are a large number of Gikuyu
men who have only one wife, simply because their economic
position would not allow them to have as many wives
as they and society would like.
Taking the Gikuyu
population as a whole, it can be said that there is an
average of two wives per head, owing to the number of
women who attain the marriageable age. Women generally
marry between the ages of fifteen and twenty, while the
majority of men start marrying from the age of twenty-five.
Thus in every generation there are more women of marriageable age than men, which helps to balance the system of
polygamy.

The Management of a Polygamous Household
In a polygamous homestead the husband has his own
hut (thingira), in which friends and casual visitors are
entertained. Each wife has her own hut where she keeps
her personal belongings.
The cooking also is done in it.
While collective ownership is a fundamental principle of
the family group, the hut is considered as the private
property of the wife and it is entirely under her control.
Each wife is provided with several lots of land located in
different places within the boundary of the family's land
(allotment). The women usually cultivate banana, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, maize, millet, yams, several varieties
of beans and other crops on these holdings.

Facing Mount Kenya
The working of the land is collective, men doing the
clearing of the virgin soil, such as cutting big trees and
hoeing, while women come behind them turning the soil
to prepare it for planting.
The planting is also divided
between men and women; the men take the responsibility
of planting banana, sugar-cane, yams and sometimes sweet
potatoes. The women plant millet, maize, various kinds of
beans and potatoes; the last are planted by both sexes.
Each wife is held responsible for what she produces from
the land, and can distribute it as she pleases, provided that
she has reserved enough food for the use of herself and
family until the next harvest. She can sell any surplus
stock in the market and buy what she likes, or keep the
proceeds for family purposes. Nowadays the majority of
women obtain money for their hut taxes in this way.
Sometimes, when the harvest is good and there is an
abundant supply of products, some are handed over to the
husband who buys sheep, goats or a cow for the betterment
of the homestead.
While the division of personal property exists between
the wives, the husband is the head of the family and the one
who contributes his labour power to all equally; he belongs
to all and all belong to him. This brings the division to
one collective ownership under his guidance.
Having described the division and distribution of labour,
it is necessary to mention something about the distribution
of love. No doubt some people wonder how one man is
able to love many women. This is a very vital question,
especially among those whose religious beliefs have taught
them that to love more than one woman is a crime, and
furthermore a sin against heavenly gods. On the contrary,
the Gikuyu are taught from childhood that to be a man is
to be able to love and keep a homestead with as many wives

179
as possible. With this in view, Gikuyu male children are
brought up to cultivate the idea and technique of extending
their love to several women and to look upon them as
companions and as members of one big family. The
girls, too, are taught how to share a husband's love and to
look upon him as the father of one big family. The idea of
sharing everything is strongly emphasised in the upbringing
of children, so when they grow up they find it natural to
share love and affection with others, for it is said that:
" To live with others is to share and to have mercy for one
another," and: "It is witch-doctors who live and eat
alone."
In order to avoid jealousy (oiru) among the wives,
Gikuyu custom provides that each wife must be visited by
her husband on certain days of the moon, particularly the
three days following menstruation.
Each wife has this
special privilege. The wives, knowing that this is the best
time to have children, see to it that the husband does
not neglect his duty of distributing his love equally among
them. Such conjugal relation is the only way in which a
polygamous homestead could he kept in harmony. The
three days immediately after menstruation are considered
as the most likely for a woman to conceive. For this reason
the husband does not generally cohabit with her again until
after the next menstruation. If by then she has conceived,
the husband allows a period of three months to elapse
before having intercourse again, in order not to cause an
abortion. After this time the husband may cohabit with
her, but only in a special way. That is, he must not have
full penetration;
he may use only about two inches of his
penis. The limit is indicated by a process in the irua
operation, when the operator gathers back the foreskin
ill to a tassel, ca11ed ngwati (the' brush,') which is arranged

180

Facing Mount Kenya

to hang at the right distance below the head of the penis.
Its use is to increase sexual excitement, but it can also
serve as a catch to check penetration.
Fuller penetration
is believed to result in destroying the womb.

Duty of the Wiyes
The women are essentially the home makers, as without
them there is no home in the Gikuyu sense of social life.
Each wife has a special duty assigned to her in the general
affairs of the homestead.
She is responsible for looking
after her hut and her household utensils, granary, and her
garden. But the duty of looking after the husband, such as
cleaning his hut, supplying him with firewood, water, food,
etc., is shared by all, in turn. For example, every morning
one of them cleans the husband's hut (thingira) and lights
the fire, while others sweep the yard and do other work
connected with the cleanliness of the homestead. At the
same time sheep and goats are fed, cows (if they have any)
are milked. Calves and kids are tended. The husband is
served with food according to what they have prepared.
Each wife provides food for her children.
When the
morning work in the homestead is over, each wife is
supposed to prepare a plan of activities for the day. Some
go to the forest to collect firewood, others go to cultivate
their gardens in the company of their friends, relatives, or
individually.
During the day-time everyone is engaged
in some sort of activity or another. No one stays at home
except the small children who are unable to accompany the
adult members of the family to the fields, or those grownups who are engaged in some homework, especially that of
grinding or beating grain in mortars.
In the evening the wives return home carrying various

Marriage System

lSI

things: firewood, water, bananas, sweet potatoes, yams
and other foodstuffs. Immediately they set about preparing
food for the evening meal. The wife whose turn it is provides the firewood and lights the fire in her husband's hut;
no cooking is done in that hut except when meat is roasted.
Otherwise each wife cooks in her own hut. When the food
is ready, each wife takes the husband's share to his hut,
where he entertains his friends and casual visitors. 'When
the meal is over and utensils cleaned, the wives may go
and spend the rest of the evening in the company of their
husbands or remain in their huts. But whenever special
visitors, particularly members of the husband's age-group
call, the wives are expected to join the company in the
husband's hut. The reason for this is to show the solidarity
of the age-group. If the visitors come from far away and
they are to spend the night in the homestead, the arrangements for their accommodation are made according to the
rules and customs governing the social affairs among the
age-group.
On these occasions the wives exercise their freedom,
which amounts to something like polyandry. Each wife is
free to choose anyone among the age-group and give him
accommodation for the night. This is looked upon as
purely social intercourse, and no feeling of jealousy or evil
is attached to it on the part of the husband or wife. And,
having all been brought up and educated in the idea of
sharing, especially at the time when they indulged in
ngwelco (love-making), their hearts are saturated with ideas
of collective enjoyment, without which there could not be
strong unity among the members of the age-group. When
this choice is freely exercised, it is an offence for a wife to
invite a man secretly to her hut, even a member of the agegroup. To do so would be regarded as committing adultery.
o

Facing Mount Kenya
In order to guard oneself against matrimonial injuries this
custom is strictly adhered to. Any man who is caught
breaking this rule is punished heavily by the kiama, and
sometimes the husband takes the law into his own hands,
and before the kiama punishes the offender he is given a
good beating by the outraged husband. There is a saying
in Gikuyu which says that " Before a man embarks upon
such an adventure of visiting another man's wife, it is
advisable for him to arm himself, for there is no mercy for
one who entices another man's wife or steals his cow."
(Ng'omoe na aka itire ndogo.) The wife, too, is punished.
She is taken back to her parents who, in order to establish
good relationship, have to pay a fine of one or two he-goats
to the husband. The fine is followed by a feast of beerdrinking between the two families. Sometimes if this
offence is repeated the wife is divorced, and the husband is
entitled to get back all his roracio; with the interests and
custody of his offspring. The divorce is preferred especially
in a case where there are no children, but in the case of
partners who have children, conciliation is considered as
the best procedure, for in this case the matter has already
ceased to be between individuals and has moved into the
clan through the children, for children are regarded as the
pledges of love and unity. It is only when the matter
becomes really bad that divorce action is taken. We will
deal with the divorce question later under that heading.
Owing to the many taboos (megiro) attached to the
cohabitation of a married woman, and the social stigma
which follows an offence, the breaking of this law is very
rare. This is due to the fact that both wife and husband
have ample opportunity of meeting their friends in a more
open and legalised way, approved by the moral code of the
community.

Marriage System
It is worth our while to mention a few of these taboos,

megiro, which control the relationship between a married
woman and an outsider and even the husband.
For
example, it is megiro for a wife to have sexual intercourse
outside the homestead; this is considered as bringing evil
and bad luck to the homestead; no wife may have sexual
intercourse while her husband is away on a journey, on
war or other activities, for to do so is to cause misfortune
to the husband. No sexual intercourse while food is being
cooked, for this will make the food impure and the result
to those who would eat such food would be uncleanliness.
Children must be put to bed before this; sexual intercourse
is not held to be right if the children are away in the fields,
for it is considered as a ritual shutting out the children
(kohingereria ciana). Sexual intercourse is practised ritually
and these and many other megiro are considered important,
and in order to maintain the harmony and prosperity of a
homestead and to guard themselves against matrimonial
injuries in the community, these megiro (taboos) must be
rigidly observed.

Divorce
Among the Gikuyu divorce is very rare, because of the
fact that a wife is regarded as the foundation-rock on which
the homestead is built.
Without her the homestead is
broken, therefore it is only when all efforts to keep the
husband and wife together have failed that an action for
divorce can be taken.
According to the Gikuyu customary law, a husband may
divorce his wife on the grounds of (1) barrenness;
(2)
refusal to render conjugal rights without reason;
(3)
practising
witchcraft;
(4) being an habitual thief;
(5) wilful desertion; (6) continual gross misconduct. A

Facing Mount Kenya
wife has the same right to divorce her husband on these
grounds, except (6) owing perhaps to the system of polygamy.
Besides the above-mentioned grounds, she can
divorce her husband for cruelty, ill-treatment, drunkenness
and impotence.
In the case of barrenness or impotence, both husband and
wife go through a practical test to prove who is to blame.
The husband would allow his wife to have sexual intercourse
with one or more of his age-grade. If this fails to bring
fruitful result, a medicine man of repute (mondo mogo) is
consulted with the hope of finding a successful solution.
At the same time ceremonial blessing from parents on the
both sides is considered essential to fertilise the womb.
Sometimes the wife succeeds in having a child in this way,
and is saved from the embarrassing situation of being given
a nickname of thaata (barren). But when all efforts fail, the
case is considered as one above the power of man, and is
attributed to the will of Ngai, the Great God.
If there
is no other disagreement between the husband and wife,
the two. can live together and perhaps have an adopted
son or daughter, providing that the man is not in a position
to marry another wife.
In case of impotence the man is given the same trial as
the woman. If he can afford it, it is necessary to marry
another wife, and in case he succeeds in having children by
her, then it is said that the failure to have children by his
first wife is due to the fact that their blood does not agree.
But if a man knows that he is naturally impotent, and
wishes to keep his homestead in harmony, he allows his
wife or wives to have sexual companions or friends to fulfil
the duty of procreation.
The children of such a union are
regarded exactly in the same way as if the real husband had
been physically fit to function sexually.

lkfarriaere Jljlster.n
When a wife is ill-treated by her husband she has the
right to return to her father for protection.
If the illtreatment is proved, the father may keep his daughter in his
homestead until such time as the husband pays a fine and
promises not to ill-treat his wife again. If a wife has borne
a child, the husband cannot claim his property which he
had given as roracio, but in case of divorce the child is
always left with the father. If the woman marries again her
former husband has the right to claim at least half of his
sheep and goats or cattle. But if she remains in her father's
homestead and perhaps has friends, no property can be
claimed. On the other hand, if she happens to have a
child during that time, the former husband can claim that
child as his, for as long as roracio is not returned, the union
is not completely dissolved.
When there are no children in a matrimonial union the
separation or divorce is much simpler than otherwise. In
the Gikuyu system of marriage the presence of children is'
a sure sign of keeping the two coupled together in harmony.

CHAPTER IX

The Gikuyu System of Government

T

HE Gikuyu system of government prior t.o the
advent of the Europeans was based on true
democratic principles. But according to the tribal
legend, once upon a time there was a king in Gikuyuland,
named Gikuyu, a grandchild of the elder daughter of the
founder of the tribe. He ruled many moons and his method
of governing was tyrannicaL People were prevented from
cultivating the land, as he commanded that all able-bodied
men should join his army and be ready to move with their
families at any time and to wherever he chose. Thus the
population lived a sort of nomadic life and suffered many
hardships from lack of food. At last they grew tired of
wandering from place to place and finally decided to settle
down. They approached the King and implored him
to let them cultivate the land and establish permanent homes,
but owing to his autocratic power he refused to hear or
consider their plea. The people were very indignant with
him for turning a deaf ear to their appeal, and in desperation
they revolted against him. The generation which carried
out the revolt was called iregi1 (revolter), and the next
generation which started cultivation was given the name
1 The word iregi is derived from rega, which means refuse,
revolt. It is the name of the age-group that revolted.

OT

System of Government
ndemi- (cutters) in remembrance of the period when the
Gikuyu people began to cut down the forests and established
themselves as agriculturalists.
After King Gikuyu was dethroned, the government of
the country was at once changed from a despotism to a
democracy which was in keeping with the wishes of the
majority of the people. This revolution is known as
itwika, derived from the word twika, which means to break
away from and signified the breaking away from autocracy
to democracy. This achievement was celebrated all over
the country; feasting, dancing and singing went on with
intervals for a period of six moons which preceded the new
era of government by the people and for the people. In
order to run the new government successfully, it was necessary to have a constitution, so during this time of festivities
a revolutionary council, njama ya itwika, was formed to
draft the constitution.
"In fact it seems probable that the
reason why kingly government was the rule in early times
is that it was rare to find persons of extremely eminent
virtue, especially as the States of those times were small.
And further, kingly power was then conferred upon
individuals as reward of services rendered to the State.
But it is the function of good men to render such services,
and if they were rewarded with kingly power, the number of
good men must have been very small. In process of time,
however, there came to be a number of persons equally
virtuous, and then they no longer submitted to kingly rule,
but sought to establish a sort of commune or constitutional
government.
From Oligarchies they passed in the first
instance to Tyrannies and from Tyrannies again to
Democracy. "2
1 The word ndemi is derived from tema, cut. So the age-group
was called cutters.

188

Facing M ount Kenya

Every village appointed a representative to the Council,
which took the responsibility of drafting the new constitution. The first Council meeting was held at a place called
Mokorwe wa Gathanga, situated in the centre of the Gikuyu
country, where the tribe is believed to have originated. At
the first meeting of the njama ya itwika it was decided that
in order to maintain harmony in the government of the
country, it was necessary to make a few rules which would
act as the guiding principles in the new government; and the
following rules, which afterwards became law, were made:
I. Freedom for the people to acquire and develop land
under a system of family ownership.
2. Universal tribal membership, as the unification of the
whole tribe, the qualification for it to be based on maturity,
and not on property. For this reason it was then decided
that every member of the community, after passing through
the circumcision ceremony as a sign of adulthood, should
take an active part in the government;
and that males
should go through this initiation between the ages of
sixteen and eighteen, and females between the age of ten
and fourteen.
3. Socially and politically all circumcised l1)en and
women should be equally full members of the tribe, and
thereby the status of a king or nobleman should be abolished.
4. The government should be in the hands of councils of
elders (kiama) chosen from all members of the community,
who had reached the age of eldership, having retired from
warriorhood.
And the position of elders should be determined by a.system of age-grading.
5. All young men between the ages of eighteen and
forty should form a warrior class (anake), and be ready to
defend the country, and that the country should respect
them and have pride in them.

System of Government

189

6. In times of need, the Government should ask the
people to contribute in rotation sheep, goats, or cattle, for
national sacrifices or other ceremonies performed for the
welfare of the whole people.
7. In order to keep up the spirit of the itwika, and to
prevent any tendency to return to the system of despotic
government, the change of, and the election for, the
government offices should be based on a rotation system of
generations. The communi ty was divided into two categories:
(a) mwangi, (h) maina or irungu. Membership was to be
determined by birth, namely, if one generation is mwangi,
their sons shall be called maina, and their grandsons be
called mwangi, and so on. It was further decided that one
generation should hold the office of government for a period
of thirty to forty years, at the end of which the ceremony
of itwika should take place to declare that the old generation
had completed its term of governing, and that the young
generation was ready to take over the administration of the
country.
8. All men and women must get married, and that no
man should be allowed to hold a responsible position other
than warrior, or become a member of the council of elders
(kiama) unless he was married and had established his own
homestead. And that women should be given the same
social status as their husbands.
9. Criminal and civil laws were established and procedure
clearly defined.
Rules and regulations governing the
behaviour between individuals and groups within the
Government were laid down.
Ndamathia and Itwika Ceremony
Besides my general knowledge of the subject, I learnt the
details of this ceremony from my late grandfather, Kongo

Facing Mount Kenya
wa Magana, who took an important part in the last itwika
ceremony, performed between 1890-1898, and also from my
relative-in-law, Kaambo wa Gethuku, who sounded the
ceremonial horn during the same celebration in Ng'enda, a
section of the Kiambu district.
When the njama ya itwika had completed the work of
drafting the constitution, a big ceremony was arranged to
set a seal upon the laws and regulations of the new Government. Great magicians were summoned to use their oracular
powers to find ways and means through which the itwi1ca
ceremony could be made sacred. At once the council of
these wise men and prophets met at their secret oracleplace in a cave by the river. After consultation it was
decided that in order to make the itwika inviolable, it was
necessary to get the tail hair of a mysterious monster known
as ndamathia, which lived in rivers. With confidence in
their powers the magicians set to work enthusiastically to
prepare medicine which would stupefy the monster and
induce him to come out of the river without being dangerous
to the people.
When the medicine was ready, the magicians went to
the njama ya itwi1caand asked for a little innocent girl who
had not yet reached the age of puberty.
One of the
ceremonial elders offered with grief his only daughter for
the national ceremony. The magicians comforted him by
saying that the child would be returned safely, for they were
sure of their magical power against the great monster

(ndamathia).
The child, her body covered with beads on which the
medicine was smeared, was taken to the river, where the
magicians had located the ndamathia, or the mysterious
monster. There the child was given a small magical gourd
to draw water from the river. At the same time one of the

System of Government
magicians began to blow a ceremonial horn rhythmically
to induce the ndamathla to come out of the river. Soon they
saw the mysterious monster splashing the water and
coming towards the ford where the child was standing
with her magical gourd. The ceremonial trumpeter was
instructed to sound the horn vigorously and to walk slowly
on the hill. The child was asked to draw the water and to
follow steadily behind sprinkling the water on the ground
as she walked along. The rest of the magicians, with a
few warriors, hid themselves in the bush along the path,
ready to pluck the tail hair of the ndamathia,
In a short time the ndamathia protruded its long neck,
the sounds of the ceremonial horn enticed the big creature
and it started to follow the man and the child. At the same
time it began to lick the ground on which the medicinewater had been sprinkled by the child. I t took some hours
before the tail of the ndamathia came out of the water, for
the creature was very long (its length is compared with
that of the rainbow, and the people believed that it was the
ndamathia which caused the rain.bow to appear on the sky).
The magicians and the warriors waited patiently to fulfil
their sacred mission. At last the tail came out of the water,
they sprung at it an.d each of them plucked as many tail hairs
as he could lay his hands on. Then immediately they
returned to the bush and ran as fast as they could to avoid
being followed by the angry monster. Because when the
hair was plucked, the pain drove the great monster mad,
and made it return back to the river at a great speed to see
who it was that dared to interfere with its sacred tail hair.
But finding no one at the ford, and owing to the stupefaction
caused by the work of the magicians, it did not bother to
return to the villages, but went straight back into the
water.

Facing Mount Kenya.
The sacred tail hair of the ndamathia was taken to the
ceremonial place where the njama ya itwika were waiting
anxiously for the return of the magicians with their sacred
objects.
The elders received the magicians with great
rejoicing for having fulfilled their mission of national
importance.
The ceremonial elder who had offered his
only daughter was rewarded and his child returned with a
title of national heroine. She was also given an important
place in the ceremony, and the same thing was done for the
man who sounded the ceremonial horn and for the
magicians.
Having received the sacred tail hair, the njama ya itwika
killed a bull, a male goat, and a fat ewe; they also fermented
beer of pure honey (moruru wa ooke), for the itwika ceremonial feast. The skins of the goat and the ewe were cut
into ribbons (ngwaro) and dipped in the contents of the
stomach mixed with the blood of the animals. The skinribbons were slit and the tail-hairs of the ndamathia tied
on to them and then every elder of the council put one of
these 011 the wrist like a bracelet, and another on the ankle;
all on the right-hand side. This acted as a seal of their
deliberation and at the same time bound them together
in their national duty. Under the leadership of the president
of the njama ya itwika, the ceremonial elders started to
sing the constitutional songs. All the words of the drafted
constitution were put into song-phrases, for as there was
no system of writing, the songs served the same purpose as
the newspapers do in the Western world.
After the njama ya itwika had concluded its preliminary
ritual and feasting, which was limited to the members of
the council of the itwika, a public proclamation of the new
government under democratic leadership was arranged to
take place at Mokorwe wa Gathanga, the headquarters of

System of Government

193

the itwika revolution, and similar arrangements were made
in all districts.
It was considered that the effective way of proclaiming
the new government was to call for war dances to be held
in every district, in order to give the population an opportunity of hearing the announcement of the new constitution. This suggestion was carried unanimously, for it was
the only way through which the words, phrases and
rhythmic movements of the new songs and dances, in
which the laws and regulations of the new democratic
government were embodied, could be introduced effectively
into the life of the community. On the day appointed, war
horns were sounded in all districts, calling the population
to come out and hear the decision of the njama ya itwika.
From early in the morning people, old and young, gathered
at the appointed place in their particular district and started
to dance joyously.
At about midday, when the sun was overhead, the ceremonial leader entered the circle which the dancers and
spectators had made. The master of the ceremony called
upon the people to sit down and listen to the ceremonial
leader. At this juncture silence was maintained, and the
ceremonial leader began to recite the constitution in the
form of a song; the assembly answered in chorus after
each phrase. This went on until the whole version was gone
through. Then the people rose and started to sing and dance
hilariously, for they were overcome with joy. The warriors
jumped, brandishing their spears and shields enthusiastically,
as a sign of welcoming the new system of government
which gave freedom and equality to all the members of the
community on the one condition only that all should
have to go through the same form of circumcision ceremony,
irrespective of the condition of their birth.

194

Facing Mount Kenya

After the proclamation ceremony and feasts were
finished, and the new government started to function, the
revolutionary council, njanza ya itwika, was dissolved, and
delegates returned to their respective villages, leaving the
officiating elder to take care of the ceremonial objects which
were necessary for the perpetuation of the itwika,
The ndemi generation was very much devoted to the
communal cause for which it had dethroned King Gikuyu.
The great desire was to give the country a new order
where every section of the community would have some
practical part to play in the people's government.
The
first step in this direction was the organisation of the people
into several groups linked up with the function of the
government.
The starting-point was the family unit.
From the
governmental point of view members of one family group
were considered as forming a family council (ndundu ya
mocie), with the father as the president. The father represented the family group in the government.
The next
group was the village council (kianza gia itora), composed
of the heads of several families in the village. The senior
elder acted as the president of the council and this group
represented the villagers in the government.
Another
wider group was formed, and named, district council
(kianza kia rogongo), in which all the elders of the district
participated; this council was presided over by a committee
(kiama kia ndundu), composed of the senior elders of the
villages. Amongst these elders the one most advanced in
age and wisdom was elected as a judge and president
(mothamaki or mociiri) of the ndundu. From the district
council a national council was formed, composed of several
ndundu, representing the whole population.
Among the
judges, a president was elected at the meetings of the national

System of Government
council. All these councils were composed of men from the
age of about thirty onwards.' But there was a very important council of young men known as njama ya ita (council
of war), its members were between the age of twenty and
forty.
This council, apart from its military activities,
represented the interests of the young people in the government. In the whole governmental organisation there was
no inheritable position, everything depending on personal
merit. Elevation to high office was based entirely upon the
behaviour of an individual to his group and to the community at large. The group had the right to recall and
dismiss or suspend any of its representatives whose behaviour was contrary to the well-established rules of
conduct. In fact, it was the voice of the people or
public opinion that ruled the country. Individualism and
self-seeking were ruled out, for every representative spoke
in the name of his particular group or in the name of the
tribe. The personal pronoun " I " was used very rarely
in public assemblies. The spirit of collectivism was so
much ingrained in the mind of the people that even eating,
drinking, working and sleeping were done collectively.
This may sound like Utopia to those who are not acquainted
with the Gikuyu tribal organisation, but the fact remains
that the system is still functioning in those parts of the
country where the people have not yet been saturated with
the Western individualistic ways of life.
From ndemi generation onwards the principles of
democratic government, as laid down by the first itwika,
continued to function favourably until it was smashed by
the British Government, who introduced a system of
government very similar to the autocratic government
which the Gikuyu people had discarded many centuries
1 See

Facing Mount Kenya
ago. The present system of rule by the Government
Officials supported by appointed chiefs, and even what is
called" indirect rule," are incompatible with the democratic
spirit of the Gikuyu people. It has been said that the
Gikuyu do not respect their chiefs, namely, the" appointed
ones." This is perfectly true, and the reason is not far to
seek. The Gikuyu people do not regard those who have
been appointed over their heads as the true representatives
of the interests of the community.
No one knows this
better than the chiefs themselves, because many of them
are only able to continue in their position through the fact
that might is over right. The Gikuyu knows perfectly well
that these chiefs are appointed to represent a particular
interest, namely, the interest of the British Government, and
as such they cannot expect popularity from the people
whom they help to oppress and exploit. In the eyes of the
Gikuyu people, the submission to a despotic rule of any
particular man or a group, white or black, is the greatest
humiliation to mankind.
The spirit of itwika, namely, the changing of government in rotationjlirough
a peaceful and constitutional
revolution, is still ingrained in the minds of the Gikuyu
people. About 1925-28 was the time when the itwika
ceremony was to take place corresponding to the last great
itwika ceremony which was celebrated about 1890-98.
The irungu or maina generation, whose turn it is to take
over the government from the mwangi generation, organised
in 1925 and began singing and dancing itwika ceremonial
songs and dances to mark the termination of rule by the
mwangi generation.
But after a short time the itwika
ceremonial dances and songs wer('!4ecla~c:!dillegal, or in
other words, " seditious," by the British Government. In
this way the present generation, irungu, has been denied

System of Government

197

the birthright of perpetuating the national pnde and
enjoyment in the peaceful institution which afforded their
forebears the most harmonious participation in the social,
political, economic, and religious organisations of the tribe.
In the Kenya White Paper of July, 1923 (cmd. 1922), it
was declared that: "It is the mission of Great Britain to
work continuously for the training and education of the
Africans towards a higher intellectual, moral, and economic
level than that which they had reached when the Crown
assumed the responsibility for the administration of this
territory."
It is beyond our comprehension to see how a
people can reach a so-called " higher level" while they are
denied the most elementary human rights of self-expression,
freedom of speech, the right to form social organisations
to improve their condition, and above all, the right to move
freely in their own country. These are the rights which the
Gikuyu people had enjoyed from time immemorial until
the arrival of the " mission of Great Britain." Instead of
advancing" towards a higher intellectual, moral, and economic level," the Africanhas
been reduced to a state of
serfdom; his initiative in social, economic and political
srructure has been denied, his spirit of manhood has been
killed and he has been subjected to the most inferior position
ill human society. If he dares to express his opinion on
.IIlY point, other than what is dictated to him, he is shouted
.11 and black-listed as an "jl.gitator."
The tribal democratic
institutions which were the boast of the country, and the
proof of tribal good sense, have been suppressed. Oppres:.ive laws and ordinances, which alone engross the monopoly
(If thought, of will, and of judgment, have been imposed
"II t he African people.
III our opinion,

" higher level" if he is free to express himself, to organise
p

Facing Mount Kenya
economically, politically, and socially, and to take part in
the government of his own country. In this way he will be
able to develop his creative mind, initiative, and personality,
which hitherto have been hindered by the multiplicity of
incomprehensible laws and ordinances.
To return to our analysis of the Gikuyu system of
government. We have seen that the circumcision ceremony
was the only qualification which gave a man the recognition
of manhood and the full right of citizenship. It is therefore
necessary to take the circumcision ceremony as our startingpoint. Before a boy goes through this ceremony he is considered as a mere child, and as such has no responsibility
in the tribal organisation; his parents are responsible for
all his actions. If he commits any crime he cannot be
prosecuted personally, it is his parents' duty to answer for
him. But this liberty ceases immediately he is circumcised,
because he is now" full grown," and has assumed the title
of mondo-morome (a he-man), and as such he must share the
responsibility with other" he-men" (arome). As soon as
his circumcision wound heals he joins in the national council
of junior warriors, njama ya anake a mumo, At this stage
his father provides him with necessary weapons, namely,
spear, shield,' and sword; then a sheep or a male goat is
given to the senior warriors of the district, who receive it
in the name of the whole national council of senior warriors.
The animal is killed for a ceremony of introducing the
young warrior into the general activities and the etiquette
of the warrior class.
In former days the ceremony was more elaborated, the
weapons of the young warrior were sprinkled with the

new supply being made, owing to the fact that they are made of

big-game hunters.

System of Government
blood of the ceremonial animal, then the leading warrior
shouted a war-cry (rohio), his companions stood up brandishing their spears and lifting their shields upwards; and
in a ritual tone they chanted in unison the following warrior's
resolution (mwehetwa wa anake): "We brandish our spears,
which is the symbol of our courageous and fighting spirit,
never to retreat or abandon our hope, or run away from our
comrades. If ever we shall make a decision, nothing will
change us; and even if the heaven should hold over us a
threat to fall and crush us, we shall take our spears and
prop it. And if there seem to be a unity between the
heaven and the earth to destroy us, we shall sink the bottom
part of our spear on the earth, preventing them from
uniting; thus keeping the two entities, the earth and the
sky, though together, apart. Our faith and our decision
never changing shall act as balance." After this ceremony
all joined in the meat feasting, and a mock fight was arranged
to test the skill of the young warrior. This initiation gave
the young warrior the privilege of participating in all
warrior's dances and songs; but he was not yet allowed to
perform or to appear inside the circle, this being reserved
for the senior warriors.
The second stage in warriorhood
was celebrated
about eighty-two moons or twelve rain seasons following
the circumcision ceremony. At this juncture the junior
warrior was promoted to the council of senior warriors,
njama ya ita (war council). The initiation fee to this rank
was two sheep or goats, there was no ritual performed at
this stage, but the animals were slaughtered and eaten in a
general meat feast. Immediately after this, the candidate
was taken to a big dance, and introduced to the higher rank
inside the circle of the dance. There he was proclaimed as
having reached the status of senior warriors.

200

Facing Mount Kenya

From the governmental point of view the whole of the
warrior class, composed of several age-groups, was divided
into two sections, from which the two councils of senior
and junior warriors were formed. Each group had its
village, district and national leaders (athamaki a riilca), who
acted as spokesmen in all matters concerning the welfare of
the groups and the tribe. These leaders were chosen by
their particular groups at general or public assembly. They
were men who had proved by their own actions, their
capability of leadership;
had shown bravery in wars,
impartiality in justice, self-sacrifice, and above all, discipline
in the group. A man with these qualities was able to attain
a high position and esteem in the community, especially
when he had retired from the activities of a warrior. Judges
and responsible elders, as we shall see later, were chosen
from such men.
The principles of the warriors' organisation, such as
age-grading and the etiquette of general behaviour, are still
adhered to inside the Gikuyu country, but owing to the
liquidation of military exercises, which was the main
function of the warrior class as the defence force of the
country, the warriors' organisation has lost the significance
which it used to have in former days.

Eldership
The third stage in manhood is marriage. When, a man
has married and has established his own homestead, he is
required to join the council of elders (kiama); he pays one
male goat or sheep and then he is initiated into a first grade
of eldership (kiama gia kamatimo), the word matimu;
which means spears, signifies the carriers of spears, which
denotes the warriors who have joined the kiama while still

System of Government

201

functioning as warriors, and who are carrying spears
because they have not yet been given the staff of office.
They are not yet elders, they are learners of the kiama's
procedures. The kamatimo act as messengers to the kiama,
and help to skin animals, to light fires, to bring firewood, to
roast meat for the senior elders, and to carry ceremonial
articles to and from the kiama assemblies. They must not
eat kidneys, spleen, or loin, for these are reserved for the
senior elders. Any kamatimo who dares eat one of these
portions from a ceremonial animal is fined a ram, which is
killed to purify the offender and at the same time to initiate
him into the secret of the higher grade of eldership.
Next to kamatimo comes kiama kia mataathi, i.e. the
council of peace, this stage is reached when a man has a son
or daughter old enough to be circumcised. Before the child
enters in the circumcision ceremony, the father is called
upon by the kiama kia mataathi of his village, and asked to
prepare himself for a ceremony called gotonyio kerera, that
is, to be initiated into the core of the tribal tradition and
custom. The initiate then consults a diviner or a seer to
predict a suitable date for the ritual; finally, a day is fixed
according to the prediction. The senior elders of the district
are invited to attend the ceremony at the candidate's
homestead.
On the day appointed, the elders of ceremonial rank
assemble and sit down in a circle outside the hut, or huts;
here they are welcomed by the candidate and his wife, or
wives. After exchanging greetings, food and drink are
brought to them, for they must first satisfy their hunger
before entering into ritual acts. Two of the elders are
appointed to act as officiating priests.
The chosen elders, carrying their staff of office, mothegi,
and sacred leaves, mataathi, enter in the hut where they are

202

Facing Mount Kenya

welcomed by the candidate and his senior wife, whose
child is about to be circumcised. A small calabash filled
with honey or sugar-cane beer is handed to them by the
man, while his wife gives them a small drinking-horn.
Four of them sit round the fireplace in the centre of the
hut. One of the elders fills the horn with the beer, he takes a
sip and spits over his right and left shoulders; then he
pours out the beer over the three stones which support a
cooking-pot over the fire; at the same time the officiating
elder calls upon the ancestral spirits to commune with them.
The horn is filled a second time and, after the leading elders
have taken a sip each, the horn is handed over to the man
who sips and then passes it to his wife. In a low and ritual
tone, all (our join in chanting a prayer, saying: "May our
child grow well and live to pass this ceremony with joy and
prosperity; may our child live to be father (or mother) of
many healthy children and thereby perpetuate our family
group."
When the preliminary ceremony is. completed, the
candidate and his wife are sworn to keep the secret of the
kiama, and never to reveal it to anyone who is not ritually
initiated into the age-grade of the kiama kia mataathi,
It is only when they have taken this solemn oath that the
secret matters and the procedure, including the etiquettes
of the Peace Council, are revealed to them. This done,
the candidate is led outside to be introduced to the assembled
elders. He walks between the two officiating elders, his
wife following behind them carrying a big calabash of beer.
The small procession enters into the circle. Here the
candidate is greeted ceremonially, to the elders he says:
" Wanyuwakine"
(" my equals");
the elders answer:
" Wanyuwakine" (" our equal "). This form of greeting
is only exchanged by those who are politically, religiously,

System of Government

203

and socially equals.
The salutation signifies that the
candidate has been accepted as a full member of the peace
council, he now sits in the circle in that capacity.
Immediately one of the elders takes the beer' and fills
a drinking horn with it. He stands facing Kere-Nyaga
(Mount Kenya), and calls upon Ngai (God) to give them
peace, wisdom and prosperity, and to bless the candidate
and his homestead.
The rest of the elders lift up their
staffs (methegi), and answer in chorus, saying: "Peace,
peace, beseech Ngai, peace be with us, peace." After this
the candidate is invested with his staff of office (mothegi)
and a bunch of sacred leaves (mataathi). This signifies
that he is now a peaceful man, that he is no longer a carrier
of spear and shield, or a pursuer of the vanity of war and
plunder. That he has now attained a stage where he has
to take the responsibility of carrying the symbols of peace
and to assume the duty of peace-maker in the community.
At the end of the ceremony of installing the candidate in
the status of the !ciama !cia mataathi, a male goat is slaughtered, its blood is poured at the entrance of the homestead,
the contents of the stomach are sprinkled at the entrance of
the hut and in the compound to keep the evil spirits away.
Finally, the sexual organ of the goat is dipped in the contents of the stomach, then it is slit and worn as a bracelet
on the right wrist of the candidate. This is a pledge of
calmness, for the sexual organ is considered as the driving
factor in fierceness, and having been symbolically cut away
and placed on the wrist, the man is thereby expected to be
guided by reason and wisdom, and not by emotion. The
ceremony is concluded with a big feast of beer and meat
and other edibles-at
this feast elders and their wives join
in singing ceremonial songs.

Facing Mount Kenya

Religious Sacrificial Council (Kiama kia Maturanguru)
The last and most honoured status in the man's life
history is the kiama kia maturanguru (religious and sacrificial council). This stage is reached when a man has had
practically all his children circumcised, and his wife (or
wives) has passed the child-bearing age. At this stage the
man has passed through all age-grades, has been initiated
to them all. Apart from his staff of office, he wears brass
rings (icohe) in his ears, but he is not yet invested with the
power to lead a sacrificial ceremony at the sacred tree
(mogumo mote wa 19ongona). To acquire this privilege he
has to pay a ewe. This is taken to the sacred tree where
the animal is slaughtered by the elders of the sacrificial
council. This ceremony is performed in secrecy and only
by the selected few who are fortunate enough to live to that
esteemed age. Noone outside the members of the sacrificial
council is allowed anywhere near the sacred tree when this
ceremony is in progress. Half of the animal is eaten by the
elders and the other half is burnt in the sacrificial fire. The
main feature of this ceremony is dedication of the man's
life to Ngai (God) and to the welfare of the community.
What actually happens at the sacred tree with regard to
preparation of the ceremony is very hard to say, for the
writer has not had the opportunity of attending the ceremony, having not yet reached the required age. But he
had the privilege of watching the elders going to and from
the sacred tree while herding sheep and goats near the
ceremonial grove called mogumo wa Njathi.
On coming out from the sacred tree the elders carry
bunches of sacred leaves called maturanguru. The elders
of this grade assume a role of" holy men." They are the

System of Government

5

20

high priests. All religious and ethical ceremonies are in
their hands.
In the previous pages we have described how the Gikuyu
tribal government was originally organised and how the
political, ethical or religious, and social groups and ranks
within it were formed. We have also seen that there were
five principal councils, namely: (I) the council of junior
warriors;
(2) the council of senior warriors ; (3) the
council of junior elders (!camatimo); (4) the council of
peace (kiama kia mataathi);
and (5) the religious or
sacrificial council (kiama Kia maturanguru). Having these
in mind, we will now proceed to analyse the functions of
these councils.

Military Organisation
The whole of the warrior class was divided into several
regimental groups, according to the system of age-grades
(riika). Every riika had its leader (motham!ci wa riika) who
was responsible for the activities of his group. His main
duty was to keep harmony and discipline in the group, and
to settle minor disputes and quarrels between the members
of his regiment; he also acted as spokesman of the group
in general matters. He was the chief composer and
organiser of songs and dances of his rii1ca, and sometimes arranged competitions between his group and other
groups. The warrior dances and songs served two main
purposes, namely, enjoyment and drill for physical development. In jumping and running, warriors developed the
power of endurance and the art of battle. In time of
war these regiments were united under the leadership of
njama ya ita (council of war) composed of several athamak]
(leaders) of the various age-grades. At the head of this

206

Facing Mount Kenya

council was a mondo mogo wa ita (war magician or priest),
whose duty was to advise the council as to the best time of
waging war. He blessed the warriors and gave them war
medicine to protect them against the enemy.
Every regiment or riika had its regimental songs and
war-cry (ndoogoya ita). There were distinctive designs on
shields and on the head-gear to distinguish each regiment.
There was no particular uniform, for warriors went to war
practically naked except for a small apron (corori), which
was worn at the back, and the head-gear (thombe ya ita).
On the outbreak of a war, a war-horn was sounded as a
signal of readiness. The warriors immediately took arms
and started shouting their particular war-cry. This brought
together all regimental units in the district and they formed
a procession towards the enemy. Each regiment followed
different directions, all leading to the battle-field.
The
senior warriors formed front lines (ngerewani), while
the junior warriors formed the rear-lines (gitungati). The
council of war went in between the two forces giving the
advice and directions to both sections. The motive of
fighting was merely to capture the livestock of the enemy
and to kill those who offered resistance. In other words,
it was a form of stealing by force of arms. Women were
rarely killed, for it was a disgrace for a warrior to kill a
woman unless it was unavoidable.
If the warriors succeeded in a war and captured the
enemy's livestock, they returned home as quickly as
possible to avoid the recapture of their loot by the enemy.
Before reaching home, after the crossing of the enemy's
boundary, they halted and counted the cattle they had
captured. The council of war then divided the 1001 among
the regiments. In the first place, brave warriors (njamba)
were rewarded according to the task performed in fighting

System of Government

207

the enemy. Then a small number of cattle were set aside
for the mothamaki wa borori (the high councillor or the chief
of the country), the medicine man was given his share,
and the other members of the council of war. If there were
any surplus left, and not enough to go round equally, it
was settled by drawing lots.
When this was done the warriors returned to their
respective districts singing songs of praise of their own
bravery (koina kaare). In these every warrior described
his action in the war and the number of men he had killed
in the battle, and also the position his victims held in their
regiments. A warrior who had not killed an enemy could
not participate in the singing of kaare songs. These brave
warriors, as they were called, went round in their districts
singing ceremonially the kaare songs. They paid visits to
their relatives and friends who gave them presents in the
form of sheep or goats and ornaments as the recognition of
their bravery in the battle. The animals thus given were
used for periodical meat feasts (lceruugu), in which the
warriors spent several days eating meat and drinking soup
mixed with various herbs and roots which served as
stimulating tonic to keep the warriors in good and healthy
condition. After Icaare songs were ended, the warriors'
long hair was shaved off, and a purification ceremony
performed to remove any curse that might have been
uttered by the dying enemies who were killed in the battle.
During this ritual cleansing the warriors were dressed in
long garments (nguo ya maribe) usually worn by the women.
They stayed in seclusion for some days, at the end of which
the long garments were discarded and the warriors resumed
their activities in normal life.
In time of peace the warriors were occupied in general
work of the tribe. They took active part in cultivation,

208

Facing Mount Kenya

in building cattle-pens and huts, herding sheep and goats
and cattle, and above all, did their physical exercises which
kept them fit for defence or attack. These activities were
organised according to seasons. When there was plenty of
work in the fields, the warriors took their full share in it
and arranged their dances and songs to take place in the
evenings, but when there was less work in the fields, then
numerous day dances and songs were arranged. Different
age-groups competed in dances, and in dexterity in throwing
spears and fencing, as well as high and long jumps.

The Cause of Tribal Warfare
Let us consider for a moment the reason why the tribal
wars were fought. The main cause of fricti()~~~!.y.reen
tribes, especially. in. Kenya, was economk.There
was no
war of annexation of terdiory·orsuhjeetion
of one tribe to
another. The fights which were carried on from time to
time between various tribes, such as the Masai, the Gikuyu
and the Wakamba, can hardly be called " wars," because all
fights were in the nature of armed raids. For example,
when cattle disease invaded the Masai country and reduced
their livestock below minimum, the Masai, whose lives
depended entirely on meat, milk, and blood of the animals,
were forced by necessity to raid the stock of their neighbours or die of hunger and starvation. In order to save
their livelihood, spies were sent out to investigate how a
successful raid could be carried out, and in what district
in the neighbouring tribes the stock were abundant and
least protected.
After the spies had reported a raid was at once organised,
and the warriors set out to get food for the tribe. Sometimes
it took days to cover a short distance, for the raiding party

System of Government
or parties travelled mostly during the night and spent the
daytime in hiding, eating and preparing for the attack.
After they located the cattle-pens they slept in a forest
nearby until the dead of night, when they stealthily crept
through the darkness and took the few herdsmen by
surprise. The cattle-pens were surrounded and a few of the
herdsmen killed to avoid any cry that would give the signal
to the warriors of the enemy's tribe. The cattle were
captured in this way and led away as quickly as possible,
in a zigzag way, and at the same time some of the
warriors were left behind to cover the trail and also to
await the enemy who might follow; so that while they were
engaged in fighting, the cattle would reach the starving
families in Masailand. Sometimes it took some days
before the raid was discovered, especially when the cattle
were grazing far away from the homesteads.
In this way the stock was lost and the lives of a few
herdsmen. We can therefore compare the" tribal warfare" with the "smash-and-grab"
practised in civilised
Europe and in America. The only difference between the
two systems is that smash-and-grab is a frequent practice,
whereas the tribal warfare was an occasional raid, with
long intervals in between. In some parts of the Gikuyu
country, especially in the centre of the country, a generation
passed without experiencing any raid at all.
Apart from the fighting strength of, say, the Gikuyu
or the Masai, there were natural features dividing the two
tribes, such as huge forests full of all kinds of dangerous
wild animals and snakes, which made the forests a very
effective blockade. Sometimes, it is said that a party of
warriors entered in the forests and never came back again,
not that they fell in the hands of the enemy, put that they
lost their way and were either devoured by the animals or

210

Facing Mount Kenya

perished by starvation, thus feeding vultures and hungry
hyenas. In places where there were no such natural barriers,
and where the two tribes came into contact frequently, peace
treaties were signed and friendly relations established. In
this case intermarriages were one form of peace-making.
To take a concrete case, my grandmother, on my father's
side, was a Masai woman called Mosana, and in reciprocity
for this friendly feeling, my aunt (i.e. elder sister of my
father) was married to a Masai chief called Sendeu, and was
treated as the head-wife. Exchange visits were made on
both sides, and I had the opportunity of visiting her
and stayed there for some months as a member of the
family.
In territories where this friendly relationship was
established, especially between the Kaptei Masai and the
Southern Gikuyu, the warriors of the two tribes joined
together to invade another section of Masai, like Loita or a
section of Gikuyu, like Mbeere or Tharaka. This information was given to me by my grandfather, Kongo wa
Magana, who led several of these attacks as a fighting
warrior and later as a magician of war.
It can be said that the relation between one tribe and
another was no more or less than the relations existing
in the present day between various tribes of Europe and
America. The only difference is that the relations between
European countries involve great suffering for the majority
of the people, either through economic fights, tariff barriers
and distribution of wealth, etc., or through actual fights in
battle-fields. The case of the Spanish Civil War, where one
tribe is fighting between itself, or the case of Japan and
China, where a strong tribe is trying to dominate a weaker
one, are illustrations.
The raids in the tribal warfare affected only a few villages,

System of Government

211

probably those along the frontiers, with the loss only of a
few hundred of their livestock which they recovered in
one way or another by a counter raid. But generally
speaking, the tribal organisation as a whole was very little
disturbed. Cultivation, which was, and still is, the source
of food supply, was carried on with little or no interference
at all, for the raiding parties did not concern themselves
with land or what grew thereon, but with the movable
property in the way of cattle, and only a small number of
sheep and goats were taken by the raiders to provide them
with food on the journey and to avoid killing cattle which
they valued highly.
Apart from the loss of livestock, chiefly cattle, we can
add the burning of a few huts which were immediately
rebuilt after the raiders had gone. The actual fighting did
not take more than six days at the most, and it took the
form of hide and seek, like an armed gang of thieves being
found, and in their desperation trying to fight their way
out. Generally the fighting was a matter of a few hours or a
day, and the raiders were either victorious or they were
defeated and the cattle restored, or in some other way they
managed to take away the cattle without any resistance,
especially in a case where the warriors of the invaded country
were away raiding another tribe. For the work of spies
was to enable the raiders to get away with cattle without
any fighting which would result in heavy loss of life. And
this was only possible at a time when the villages were not
properly protected.
Since the coming of the Europeans the warrior organisationhasbeen rendered powerless, for although the system of
age-grading still exists (except the formation of njamaya ita)
the spirit of manhood in the youth has been almost killed by
the imposition of imperialistic rule which restricts people

2.12

Facing Mount Kenya

from moving and functioning freely in their own country.
The European prides himself on having done a great
service to the Africans by stopping the " tribal warfares,"
and says that the Africans ought to thank the strong power
that has liberated them from their "constant fear" of
being attacked by the neighbouring warlike tribes. But
consider the difference between the method and. motive
employed in the so-called savage tribal warfares, and those
employed in the modern warfare waged by the" civilised"
tribes of Europe, and in which the Africans who have no
part in the quarrels are forced to fight to defend so-called
democracy. Take the case of the Great War, 1914-18, in
which tens of thousands of Africans lost their lives. The
reward for this was taking away the best lands from the
Africans, the introduction of kipande with its diabolical
system of finger-prints as though the Africans were criminals, imposition of heavy taxation and denial of freedom of
speech, of the Press, and of forming political or social
organisations.
This is what "democratic Britain" did
in recognition of the services rendered by the Kenya
Africans during 1914-18. Another example is the Italian
invasion of Ethiopia, where the wholesale massacre of the
defenceless population took place to demonstrate European civilisation. With these glaring facts in view can the
Europeans boast of having stopped the " tribal warfare"
and having established "perpetual
peace" in Africa?
It would have been much better for the Africans to continue
with their tribal warfare, which they fought with pride and
with the loss of a few warriors, rather than receiving the
so-called civilising missions which means the subjugation
of the African races to a perpetual state of serfdom.
In the old order of the African society, with all the evils
that are supposed to be connected with it, a man was a

System of Government

213

man, and as such he had the rights of a man and liberty to
exercise his will and thought in a direction which suited his
purposes as well as those of his fellow-men; but to-day an
African, no matter what his station in life, is like a horse
which moves only in the direction that the rider pulls the
rein. The harmony and stability of the African's mode of
life, in political, social, religious and economic organisations,
was based on the land which was, and still is, the soul
of the people. The first step which the European civilising
missions took to disorganise the Africans in order to
exploit and oppress them, especially in South and East
Africa, was to take away the best African lands. This is
one of the evils of European civilisation that has found its
way to the great African continent, and one which the past,
present, and future African generations will never forget.
The land not only unites the living members of the tribe
but also the dead ancestors and the unborn posterity. This
fact is obvious, because it is in the ancestral lands that the
ancestors lie buried, in the land which they once occupied.
In this way the dead are able to keep direct communication
with the living, and the sanctions which control behaviour
in both the collective life of the tribe and private lives of its
individual members are the approval or disapproval of the
ancestral spirits. Through incarnation the future generation is linked up with the past, thus bringing spiritually
the three groups, i.e. dead, living and unborn, into one
organic whole. The annexation of the ancestral lands by
the Europeans has robbed the African of the use of the
productive asset on which his entire economic life depended.
It has also interfered with the whole tribal organisation
whose genuine co-operation is based on constant communion with the ancestral spirits through which tribal law
and custom, morality, and religion are maintained.
Q

214

Facing Mount Kenya

We have discussed at length the activities of the warriors
in the old Gikuyu system of government, and the present
condition under which the warriors as well as others find
themselves. We will now enter into an analysis of the old
system of judicial procedure, how it was conducted and
who took part in it.

Procedure
In every homestead the father acted as judge; he settled
all minor disputes between the members of his family. If
there was a big dispute it was necessary to call together
the heads of families within a mbari (kinsfolk), who
acted not only as the heads of their particular immediate
families but also in their capacity as elders of the 1ciama.
All such matters were treated as a family concern, and as
such it was the privilege of the family council (ndundu ya
mocie) to deal with the cases within the precincts of their
homesteads. These elders acted as arbitrators rather than
judges, their duty was to point out the recognised tradition
and custom of the family to be followed. The chief object
in their deliberations was to find ways and means by which
they could bring the disputing parties into a mutual agreement, and to avoid any act of vengeance which might result
in breaking up the family group. No case could go before
general assembly or public court of the elders before it had
been first tried by the family council. When two relatives
had a dispute, the offended party brewed a sugar-cane
beer as a sign of taking action. The night when the beer
was being fermented he went or sent round for the elders
of his family council and informed them that there was a
dispute to be settled between himself and another member
of the group. He therefore invited the elders to come

System of Government

5

21

on the following morning and bring with them the
offender.
On the next morning the beer was strained into two or
three calabashes.
After the sheep and goats were taken
to pastures, the elders arrived one by one, the offender
who had been informed about the meeting, came all by
himself or in company of his friends. The beer was presented to the assembled elders as a sign of peaceful and
friendly discussion. They were informed why the beer had
been brewed, then the senior elder among those present
took a ceremonial drinking-horn (rohea rwa goitanga) and
filled it with the beer. This was poured on the ground,
and in a loud and ritual tone he invoked the ancestral
spirits to join them in their deliberation.
When he had
done this, he stood up holding his staff of office (motheegi),
and facing Kere-Nyaga, uttered a prayer in the following
words: "Athuuri~ ugai nyomha eraiguana" (i.e. "Elders, say
let there be agreement and peace in the family group ").
The elders answered in chorus:
"Nyomba eroiguana,
thaai thathayai Ngai thaai" (i.e. " Let there be peace in the
family group, beseech Ngai, peace be with us "). He then
proceeded to utter curses for anyone who might disobey
the impartial decision of the kiama: "Ugai mondo area
okararagia kiama arwaga na mode wake na mogonda" (i.e.
" Elders, say let curses be upon him who disobeys kiama's
decision; let curses lie upon his homestead and his fields ").
The elders answer in chorus: "Let curses be upon him
and his homestead and fields."
After this ceremony was completed the elders sat in
council to hear the case. The plaintiff was called upon to
state his case. He entered in the circle holding a bunch of
twigs as a record of his statement, or in other words as
notes for reference. At the end of each concrete statement

216

Facing Mount Kenya

of a complaint or claim he handed over to the elders one
twig. The twigs thus handed were held by the presiding
elder. The defendant was then called to defend himself or
plead guilty. He stated his case and handed over twigs
which were held by another elder.
To make this clear let us suppose that a man whom we
will call A was claiming two sheep, three goats, and one
heifer from his relative who we shall call B. Mr. A would
stand up and begin to describe the colour and size of his
two sheep. He would hold one of the twigs and tell the
elders that one of his sheep was big and black, then he
would hand over a long twig; then he would say that the
other sheep was brown and small, for that he would hand
over a shorter twig. He would then pass on to his three
goats and describe them in the same manner, and then on
to his heifer. When he had finished, Mr. B would be given
the twigs which represented the claim of Mr. A and asked
to admit or deny the charge. The twigs then were returned
to the presiding elder.
When both had finished making their statements,the
case was open for discussion. In this all the elders joined
and each expressed his opinion either for or against one of
the party, the twigs serving as the reference in the matter.
After the whole case was reviewed and witnesses examined
and cross-examined, the elders appointed a committee
(ndundu) to give judgment for the case. The ndundu
retired alone in a private place where no one could hear
them. Immediate relatives such as father, uncle or brother
of either party were excluded from the ndundu.
After discussing the merit and demerit of the case, and
having agreed as to what was a proper and impartial
judgment of the case, the ndundu returned to the council
with the twigs arranged according to their decision. The

System of Government

217

twigs were handed over to the senior elder who announced
the decision. The two men in the dispute were called
before the elders and asked if they agreed with the judgment
given or if either of them wanted to appeal. If both agreed,
then all the elders stood up beating their staves together
and at the same time reciting some ritual words which
indicated that the case was settled for good. Two of the
senior elders were then appointed to see that the judgment
was carried out.
Having described the way in which a family dispute was
settled, we will now pass on to analyse the type of case
which was sent to a public court or elders' assembly, and
how they were settled.
In the Gikuyu country there was no special courthouse,
but there were several recognised meeting-places (keharo,
pl. iharo) where the kiama or the council of elders met in the
open air under a tree. All big cases and other matters of
national importance were settled there. The majority of
cases which were heard in the kiama general assemblies
were those dealing with debts resulting from transactions of
sheep and goats or cattle which were exchanged in buying
land or paying marriage insurances (roracio). There were
also a few criminal cases, such as murder (which was rare),
theft, trespass, assault, and witchcraft.

Civil Procedure
According to the Gikuyu law and custom, if Mr. A
bought something from Mr. B for which he paid him four
sheep or goats, should any of the animals die before it had a
kid, Mr. B had to return the carcass to Mr. A who would
replace the dead animal. On the other hand, if Mr. B
failed to fulfil the contract for which Mr. A had paid the

ll8

Facing M aunt Kenya

four sheep, then Mr. A had the right to claim back the
original number with their offspring and without paying
any compensation to Mr. B for looking after the animals.
But in case of a land transaction where sheep, goats or
cattle had been exchanged, if after a year or so the bargain
was broken, the return of the animals' offspring could not
be claimed, for the land also gave fruits which were equal
to the offspring of the animal.
Another example of how an individual or a family group
got into debt is a case of unsuccessful marriage. Sometimes
this involved a rather complicated proceeding in the kiama
assembly. For instance, when a man had paid forty sheep
and goats to his father-in-law as roracio (" bride price")
and if after two or three years time his wife ran away with
another man or divorced him without a good reason, the
husband was entitled to claim the return of all the animals
and the offspring thereof, especially if there were no
children of the marriage. This type of case involved a lot
of investigations on the part of the elders who tried it.
For each sheep or goat or cow was traced from the time it
left the homestead of the first owner to the time of dispute.
If the parents-in-law had sold or exchanged one of the
animals, they must redeem it from the person it had passed
to. Sometimes a case of this nature involved several persons
who had either bought or had been given the animal during
the celebration of the marriage ceremony or after the
marriage contract was signed.
The proper procedure adopted in recovering a debt was
that a man brewed sugar-cane beer and took it to his
debtor. He took with him also one of the elders of his
village. The beer was presented to the debtor as a reminder
and as a sign of friendship and of the wish to settle the matter
peacefully. In this way the debtor might be moved by the

System

of

Government

219

friendly approach and perhaps make full settlement of the
debt or promise to pay it in instalments. If the debt was
not paid, another beer was prepared and presented to the
debtor, and this time two elders accompanied the creditor. If
this failed to bring any successful arrangement towards
settlement of the debt, a third visit was made, taking the
beer as before, and three elders as witnesses. Now the
creditor had full right to take the matter before the kiama,
because he had tried his best to persuade his debtor to settle
the matter mutually out of court and had failed.
The next step was that the creditor or claimant went
to the elders of his village and laid his case before them.
He asked them to call on the elders of the neighbouring
villages and arrange for the hearing of his case. After the
elders had consulted together, a date was fixed for the
case to be heard. As there was no system of writing, notices
were sent verbally by the Iciama's messengers to all those
concerned in the case.
On the day appointed the elders gathered at their openair court, under a shady tree, where they squatted in a semicircle. Then a ceremonial elder rose and recited a prayer
asking for peaceful deliberation of the kiama and prosperity
for the country. At the end of this the two parties in the
case were called before the assembly to state the nature of
their case. After the number of sheep, goats or cattle
involved was specified, both parties were asked to pay
court fees before the case was heard. Fees were paid in
kind, namely, sheep or male goats. In big cases such as
inheritance or land cases a bull was paid, especially where
cattle were involved. The fees paid to the elders depended
on the number of animals connected with the case. For
instance, if the plaintiff was claiming five sheep or goats, his
court fees would be two or three gourds of beer. If the

220

Facing Mount Kenya

number of animals claimed was between ten and twenty,
the court fees would be one fat ram or a male goat.
Both plaintiff and defendant brought their court fees
in form of a ram or a male goat and handed them to the
elders; if accepted, the animals were tied to a tree nearby
ready to be slaughtered. The elders then sat in the council
according to their grades. In the inner semicircle were the
Iciama Icia maturanguru, behind them came the kiama kia
mataathi, then followed the kiama gia kamatimo and the
general public who came to listen to the case.
The two contesting parties were invited into the circle
to state their case to the assembly. Among the judges
(athamaki) two elders were appointed to conduct the
proceedings on behalf the whole council. In giving the
evidence twigs were used in the same way as already stated
in dealing with the family dispute. The two appointed
elders took charge of the twigs and conducted the examination and cross-examination.
Any other member of the
council had the right to intervene and ask questions or
make a statement, but generally this was done through
the conducting elders. After all the evidence was heard
from both sides, the case was open for discussion in general
assembly. Anyone in the assembly could stand up and
express his opinion. In this way the young people were
given an opportunity
to develop and improve their
talent in legal matters; for with no special school for this,
the assemblies served two purposes, for deciding cases or
settling disputes, and at the same time giving practical
legal education to the youth.
At the conclusion of the general discussion a committee
of judges (ndundu ya athamaki) was appointed;
both
parties were allowed to choose two elders each to represent
them in the committee.
The rest were chosen by the

System

of

Government

221

assembly, for the committee was composed of ten or twelve
elders. Anyone known to have direct or indirect interest
in the case was excluded from
committee so as to avoid
any biased judgment.
Before the committee retired to
consider the case, the ceremonial elder stood and uttered
curses on anyone who might try to force wrong judgment
through the influence of bribery and corruption.
This
form of curse acted as a check against the evils of bribery
and corruption, for no one would agree to sit on the
committee knowing that he had been bribed to pervert the
course of justice.
After receiving the caution, the committee (ndundu ya
athamaki) retired alone to discuss the matter in private,
taking with them for reference the twigs from both
parties. While the ndunda ya athamaki was discussing
the case, the animal which had been given as court fees was
being slaughtered and the meat roasted over a fire. This
duty fell on the kamatimo elders who at this time sat in a
separate group. The galls of the animals were taken out
and handed over to the ndundu ya athamaki (committee of
judges). The galls were then broken with a piece of stick
from a shrub called m~gere. In doing so the elders shouted
in one voice, saying: "Let evil be upon him who disobeys
our decision, may his galls be broken in the same way as
we have broken these of the animal." Then the ndundu,
having agreed as to the judgment of the case, cut twigs and
arranged them according to their finding. The presiding
elder of the ndundu recites what each twig represents in a
ritual tone; the rest answer in chorus as a sign of their
agreement.
After the ndundu had concluded their discussion, the meat
which had been roasted was distributed according to
the rank's of the kiama, Certain joints went to the kiama kia

the

222

Facing Mount Kenya

maturanguru, mataathi, kamatimo, and the rest to the nonmembers of the kiama. Skins, heads and the fat tails of
rams went to privileged senior elders who took them horne
to their wives.
After the meat was eaten, the court reassembled and the
committee of the judges gave their decision. The presiding
elder stood and invoked poverty, sickness and calamity
upon anyone who unreasonably refused to obey the kiama's
decision. He then uttered a blessing for the assembly and
for the general welfare of the community. In each case all
those present answered in unison.
At the end of this judicial ceremony the two parties in
the dispute were called and asked if they had confidence
in the elders. To this they answered in the affirmative;
then came the official announcer of judgments who had
been told privately the finding of the ndundu, He stood in
the circle surrounded by the elders. Afrei" telling one or
two stories of ancient times and court procedures of the
days gone by, as a "grand climax, he pronounced the
judgment on the pr~sent case. The whole assembly rose
and gave a yell as the sign of their agreement.
Two elders were appointed to see that the judgment was
carried out. The property involved in the judgment was
not given to the plaintiff directly, but was passed through
the hands of the appointed elders who acted on behalf of
the whole ldama. If the claim was not settled the plaintiff
could not go directly to the defendant, his proper channel
was through the elders in charge of the case. Kiama
judgment was invariably carried out, the curses acting as a
police force. The fear of public opinion expressed in the
way of curses was the chief preventative of mischief and
crimes, because there was no police organisation in the
Gikuyu society.

System of Government

223

If one of the parties did not agree with the kiama decision
lie was given an ample opportunity to appeal and had his
case re-heard. In this case he had to take a strong oath
to prove that there was ground for his appeal, and that he
was not playing tricks with the kiama.
In the Gikuyu society, oath or ordeal was the most
important factor controlling the court procedures.
It
served two purposes.
On the one hand, the fear of it
prevented people from giving false evidence, and helped to
bring the offenders to justice through guilty conscience and
confession. On the other hand, it ruled out bribery and
corruption and ensured impartial or unbiased judgment.
For not only the parties in a case were subjected to take
oath of one kind or another, but also the elders of the kiama
were sworn in before being allowed to try a case. In this
oath the elders promised that they would not accept bribery
or any private gift from those concerned in the case or
from anyone else acting on their behalf.
Among the Gikuyu there were three important forms of
oaths which were so terribly feared, morally and religiously,
that no one dared to take them unless he was perfectly sure
and beyond any doubt that he was innocent or that his
claim was genuine.
For the interest of our readers we will here give a short
description of the three kinds of oaths and their symbols.
First, there was muma. This was taken generally on minor
disputes. The symbol of the oath consisted of a lamb
which was killed and the contents of the stomach mixed
with herbs, water, and a little of the blood of the animal.
The compound was put into a wild banana leaf (icoya rea
ihendu) and then placed in a small hole dug in the ground,
the medicine man (mondo nwgo) tied a brush of twigs and
leaves from a ceremonial shrub called mogere. Then the

224

Facing Mount Kenya

party concerned in the case knelt down towards the
hole. The mondo moga dipped the brush into the mixture
and lifted it to the mouth of the kneeling man, who took
the oath by licking the brush, saying: "If I tell a lie, let
this symbol of truth kill me. If I falsely accuse anyone,
let this symbol of truth kill me. If the property I am now
claiming is not mine, let this symbol of truth kill me."
The symbol of the second oath is karinga thenge (to
swear by killing a male goat). This form of oath was
administered in a big case with a lot of property, involving
more than one or two persons. A small male goat was
brought before the Iciama and the parties concerned were
asked to take an oath by breaking all the limbs of the animal.
The male goat was spread on a rock in a lonely and uncultivated field, then a ceremonial stone (ngangae) was handed
in turn to each individual who proceeded to break the bones
of the male goat, saying: "If the property I am now claiming is not mine, let my limbs be smashed to smithereens
like the bones of this male goat. If I am claiming more
than what is due to me, let my family group be crushed
like the bones of this male goat."
The third form of oath is gethathi; this was taken mostly
in criminal cases such as murder or stealing. The symbol
of this oath consisted of a small red stone with seven
natural holes on it. The stone was put on a small stick
which was planted on the ground.
The elders stood at
a little distance facing the spot where the oath ceremony
was being prepared. The place must be a barren ground
not likely to be cultivated, for no one would allow the
ceremony to be performed on or near his cultivation. It
was feared that the evil of the oath symbol might spread to
a cultivated crop and destroy it.
When the preparation was done, the accused persons

System of Government

225

were asked to pass several grass stalks (ngoonda) through
each hole seven times, at the same time swearing to
the validity of their statement which they had made or
were about to make. While this was taking place all the
elders present put a piece of creeper (mokengeria) on their
ears to protect themselves against the evil of the symbol of
the oath. Women were excluded from taking any of these
oaths. Their husbands or sons took the responsibility, for
the women were not considered fit mentally and bodily to
stand the ordeal which involved not only the individual
going through it but the whole family group.
Nowadays these oaths and ordeals are neglected and
discouraged by the European administration who regard
them as mere superstition.
Instead, the Europeans have
adopted a form of raising hands or kissing the Bible as
symbols of oath. It can be definitely said that this form of
oath has no meaning at all to the Africans. It has no binding
force, moral or religious. The result has been fabrication
of evidence in courts of justice, and furthermore, bribery
and corruption is the order of the day in many cases that
come before a magistrate or a court of elders. It would not
be exaggeration to say that in most cases judgment depends
entirely on who pays most. I speak here with experience
in both European and kiama courts, where bribery and
corruption are prevalent.
The reason for this miscarriage of justice is that the chiefs
and elders who are entrusted with the administration of
justice are very poorly paid by the British Government.
Their wages or salary runs from ten shillings to about
£ 5 per month. With this they are expected to display their
power and wealth. However, in spite of the small salary
which these chiefs receive, the moment a man is appointed
a chief or a headman, immediately he starts to accumulate

226

Facing Mount Kenya

large herds of sheep, goats and cattle, and also a number of
wives. It cannot, therefore, be denied that the Government
is aware of the diabolical state of bribery and corruption
existing and displayed under their very eyes. The above
remark is strictly directed to the chiefs who are appointed
over the heads of the majority of the people, and who,
like their masters, want to get rich quick at the expense of
the poor Africans who have no voice at all in the
administration of their country. This state of affairs can be
stopped if the Government is willing by letting the people
have power of choosing their chiefs under a democratic
system, and power to dismiss them when they abuse their
position.
We have now seen how the judicial procedure in civil
cases was conducted. Let us for a moment turn to personal
injuries or assaults. Redress for insults was settled out of
court, no man with any dignity would take another to
court for an insult. A man was considered responsible and
capable of taking care of his dignity and seeing that it was
not abused. The proper procedure was duelling or fencing.
If a man insulted another an apology was asked, and made
by paying a small tribute of banana or a calabash of beer
or gruel to the age-group of the insulted man. If this was
refused he was asked to be ready for a duel. There and
then the two men, in the presence of their friends, settled
the quarrel by duelling. After this the two men shook
hands and became friends again.

Criminal Procedure
In the Gikuyu society all criminal cases were treated
almost in the same way as civil cases. The chief aim in
proceeding was to get compensation for the individual or the

System of Government

227

group against whom the crime was committed. Since there
was no system of imprisonment, the offenders were punished
by being made to pay heavy fines to the kiama and
compensation to rIght· the wrong done.
Murder and manslaughter were treated in the same way,
for the kiama was not chiefly concerned with the motive of
the crime or the way in which the crime was committed, but
with the fact that one man had taken another man's life.
Premeditated murders were very rare among the Gikuyu,
for it was a crime against society for a man to strike
another without warning him, unless he was a foreign
enemy. If a man killed another in cold blood the murderer
was treated with the greatest contempt, because not only
had he disgraced himself but also his age-group. But
if it happened that two men were engaged in a fight
and one of them was killed or died of the wound,
in such a case the murderer had the sympathy and
respect of the community, because he acted in a manly
fashion and in self-defence. For this reason the murderer
was treated leniently in his trial.
The first step in a murder case was that the family group
of the murdered man took up arms and invaded the
murderer's homestead with the object of killing the murderer
or one of his close relatives, and letting them realise that the
murdered man had a family group capable of inflicting
retribution on behalf of one of its members. If the invaders
succeeded in killing the murderer or one of his kinsfolk,
the case was settled there and then, for the two Iives were
considered equal. But if this failed, the family group of
the dead man invaded the cultivated fields of the murderer's
family group. The crops thereon, such as bananas, sugarcane and yams, were razed to the ground by the swords of
the invaders as a sign of indignation and mourning for the

228

Facing Mount Kenya

death of one of their kinsmen. Whenever there was a
conflict between one family group and another as stated
above, it was the duty of the elders of the peace council to
intervene and bring the quarrelling parties to conciliation.
In this way private revenge and blood feud was checked by
settling the matter peacefully once and for all before the
court of elders.
Universal rules were made fixing the amount payable
as compensation for loss of life, according to sex. The
rules aimed at punishing a murderer, irrespective of whether
he killed a man instantly or caused him to die of the wound
inflicted in a fight. If a man wounded another seriously
he was asked to provide a male goat, which was killed to
supply nourishment for the wounded man. If the wound
healed the matter ended there, but if sooner or later he
died, the man was charged with murder, because the providing of a male goat was considered as pleading guilty
to the charge.
The compensation for loss of life of a man was fixed at
one hundred sheep or goats or ten cows. For a woman's
life thirty sheep or goats or three cows. The only exception to these rules was when a man or a woman was killed
by poisoning or witchcraft. This was looked upon as a
crime against the whole community, and the penalty was
death by burning as stated in the chapter dealing with
Magical Practices.
Apart from the fact that there was inequality of sex in
the Gikuyu society (as in most of the early human societies),
which was responsible for the great difference between the
value of a man's life and that of a woman's, as shown in
the above rules, the only other explanation would be that the
Giku yu conception of value of life was according to services
which a man or a woman would have rendered to his family

System of Government

229

group during lifetime. And, therefore, it was considered
right and proper to fix the compensation for loss of a
woman's life to thirty sheep or goats or three cows, the
same number as that which was given for the marriage
ceremony, after which the girl entered into the activities of
another family unit and ceased to serve her own parents or
family group. But a man was considered as permanently
part and parcel of his family group, and as such his services
were continuously rendered for the benefit of his family
group during his lifetime. And therefore the number of
one hundred sheep or goats or ten cows was assessed on the
assumption that the man would have been able, had he
lived, to bring property to his group equal in value to that
fixed for compensation for the loss of his life. The rule
applied to all males and females in the community from the
time of birth to the time of death. There was no distinction,
whether it was a male or female baby murdered or a rich
man or woman, the compensation was the same as stated
above.
Next to murder cases came personal injury inflicted on
a man or woman. Any bodily hurt or cut without loss of a
limb was not considered as a serious crime, for it was a
common happening, especially in a community like Gikuyu
or Masai, where quarrels between two individuals or groups
were always settled by a fight or a duel. In case of loss of a
limb or part of it, there was a payment for compensation
fixed for each limb. For example, loss of a finger was
compensated by ten sheep or goats. F or loss of hand or
arm thirty sheep or goats. For one ear ten sheep or goats.
For a tooth one sheep or goat, and so on. These rules
varied according to the wealth of the various districts.
The punishment for adultery or rape was that the man
paid a fine of three fat rams to the kiama and nine sheep or
R

goats to the husband or parents. In some cases the offender
was ostracised. The stigma attached to the ostracism was
far greater and very much worse than that attached to the
European formof itl1p_ri?onment. Many Gikuyu would
preier
-to jail rather than to be ostracised. The fear
of this was one of the chief factors which prevented the
people from committing crimes.
Next came theft; this depended on what was stolen, and
the fines were fixed according to the article or the animal
the thief had taken. For instance, if a man had stolen a
sheep, he was required to return the original sheep with
another one to " purify" it. If the stolen sheep was killed
and eaten, the crime became serious and the thief, with all
those who participated in eating the meat, were fined ten
sheep or goats each. If a man had stolen honey from
another man's bee-hive, the fines were thirty sheep or goats.
In spite of these fines, if a man found a thief stealing his
property, he had the right to take the law into his own
hands and beat the thief to his satisfaction and then bring
him before the kiama to be fined. J n everyone of these
cases the offender had to give one fat ram to the kiama as
court fees. If a man became a habitual thief, he was looked
upon as a public danger and was put to death publicly,
sometimes by being beaten to death or burnt in the same
way as a witch or wizard. In the Gikuyu society theft and
witchcraft were considered as very serious criminal offences.

CHAPTER

X

Gikuyu Religion, Ancestor Worship,
and Sacrificial Practices

T

HE Gikuyu people, it is certain, maintain a close
and vital relationship
with spiritual entities.
Their daily lives, both as individuals and groups,
are influenced at all points by belief in the supernatural.
It is then of the very first importance to know the nature
of the beliefs themselves and of the Beings in whom they
are reposed. Is there a belief in a single High God? If
so, is it a vital belief or a mere formalism? Who and what
is the High God? Is He a mere abstraction, easily forgotten,
or a real entity, visible both in picturesque dwelling-places
and in His awful or beneficent works?
These and many such questions must be asked and
answered before we begin to appreciate the religious life
of the Gikuyu people, as of any other people. Further,
are there any other spiritual creatures besides the Deity,
and, if so, how do they function in the day-to-day, year-toyear life of the people ? We shall assume that there are
such beings, the spirits of our ancestors. With them we
constantly commune. Hence the first two elements in the
title of this chapter. Further, sacrificial practices are of such
importance in establishing connections with both the High
231

232

Facing Mount Kenya

God and the other supernatural Beings that I have given
them a third place in the title. Our work is to bring out
the functioning mode of these two great departments of
Gikuyu religion and of the main means of their formal
expression in the sacrificial ceremonies which everywhere
define and punctuate them. To do this adequately it is
necessary to describe various forms of religious ceremonies
and sacrifices. In this way we shall make clear the
differences between the three parts of our subject-matter:
Deity worship, communion with ancestors, and sacrificial
practices.
The ideas underlying these three expressions may best be
brought out by means of linguistic analysis. First, we
have gothaithaya Ngai, which may clearly be translated:
" To beseech Ngai," or " To worship Ngai." The essential difference between Deity worship, in the true sense, and
what is known as " ancestor worship," is demonstrated by
the fact that gothaithaya is never used in connection with
ancestral spirits. The term used for what I shall call
" communion with ancestors" is goitangera ngoma njohiliterally, "to pour out or to sprinkle beer for spirits."
This refers to the pouring out of a little of whatever you are
drinking on to the ground for the ancestors, and, in a special
sense, to a larger offering of a similar nature made on the
occasion of communion ceremonies, when a special quantity
of beer is brewed for presentation to the ancestral spirits.
At the same time a beast will be sacrificed. Generally on
special occasions these two elements are necessary.
When both the beer and the animal are offered, an
additional term has to be used: gothenjera na goitangera
ngoma njohi-literally, c c to slaughter and to pour out beer
for the spirits." It will be clear from this that the Gikuyu
people have a clear idea and understanding of two super-

Religion and Ancestor Worship

2.33

natural elements. On the one hand is the relationship with
the one High God, Ngai, which may accurately be termed
one of worship. Gikuyu religion has definitely two
departments. Both are really vital; they function in unison,
but in different spheres. We shall find, for example, that
when a sacrifice is made to the High God on an occasion of
national (tribal) importance, the ancestors must join in
making the sacrifice.
The term for" sacrificial practices" is koruta magongona,
" to offer or to perform sacrifices or rituals and ceremonies."
Igongona (sing.) is the only Gikuyu word which can
possibly be translated "religion,"
although mambura
(lit. "sacred ") is practically synonymous with it. These
words convey the idea of sacredness in general, so that
koruta magongona may also be translated" sacred offerings."
These are carried out, as we shall see, in connection with
both Ngai worship and ngoma communion.
It may be worth mentioning at this stage that Christian
missionaries in Gikuyu country have ignored both of the
Gikuyu words for religion. The reason is probably that
they feel them to be associated with" native ideas of spirit
worship." Instead, the Swahili term, dini, has been imported.

The Conception of a Deity
The Gikuyu believes in one God, Ngai, the creator and
giver of all things. Ngai moombl wa indo ciothe na mohei
kerende indo ciothe. He has no father, mother, or companion
of any kind. His work is done in solitude. Ngai ndere ithe
kana nyina, ndere gethia kana gethethwa.
He loves or hates
people according to their behaviour.
The creator lives in
the sky. Ngai eikaraga matuine, but has temporary homes
on earth, situated on mountains, where he may rest during

234

Facing Mount Kenya

his visits. The visits are made with a view to his carrying
out a kind of "general inspection," koroora thi, and to
bring blessings and punishments to the people. Korehere
ando kiguni kana gitei.
The common name used in speaking of the Supreme
Being is Ngai; this name is used by three neighbouring
tribes, the Masai, the Gikuyu, and Wakamba. In prayers
and sacrifices Ngai is addressed by the Gikuyu as MweneNyaga (possessor of brightness). This name is associated
with Kere-Nyaga (the Gikuyu name for Mount Kenya),
which means:
That which possesses brightness, or
mountain of brightness.
The mountain of brightness is believed by the Gikuyu
to be Ngai's official resting-place, and in their prayers they
turn towards Kere-Nyaga and, with their hands raised
towards it, they offer their sacrifices, taking the mountain
to be the holy earthly dwelling-place of Ngai. Kenyororokero na kehuroko kia Mwene-Nyaga-literally,
"descending
and resting- or dwelling-place of God."
The Being thus described cannot be seen by ordinary
mortal eyes. He is a distant Being and takes but little
interest in individuals in their daily walks of life. Yet at
the crises of their lives he is invariably called upon. At the
birth, initiation, marriage, and death of every Gikuyu,
communication is established on his behalf with Ngai.
The ceremonies for these four events leave no doubt as to
the importance of the spiritual assistance which is essential
to them.
This assistance is always obtained, however, by the
family group. No individual may directly supplicate the
Almighty.
The group which may do so is 'very clearly
defined; it is the group of mother, father, and children,
which thus receives supernatural sanction. The father is the

Religion and Ancestor Worship

235

key personality. A group of families or clan cannot function together except in times of tribal crisis, for each will
have its own father. The family may, especially if polygamous, number one or two hundred souls. The" father
may in fact be a great-grandfather, but excepting only those
of his children who have settled elsewhere, the family unit
thus defined is the religious unit. Although the crises
are in the life of the individual, he may not make supplication on his own behalf; his whole family group must
pledge their interest in his life.
There are occasions in each man's life, apart from the
four main crises, when he requires spiritual assistance. He
may have broken a taboo; he may attribute some ill luck
to such an infraction. This is reckoned as an individual
matter, and Ngai is not approached. The man's purification or absolution is achieved by means of the medicine
man, who will work by establishing contact with such of
the ancestral spirits as may be thought to be involved. It is
possible that only one ancestor will need to he propitiated,
and there will be no need for the whole family group to be
brought into action to approach him. This is reserved for
appeal to Ngai himself. Thus are the four main crises of
life marked off from its minor difficulties. Religion deals
with the former; communion with the ancestors suffices
for the latter. Every other occasion again is transcended by
crises involving the whole tribe, such as a threatened
drought. Then, of course, Ngai himself must be appealed
to, and the appeal must be made by the active participation
of the whole people.
To see whether linguistic analysis will help us to emphasise these points: Ngai eikaraga matuine, na nderoranagia na wera wa mondo omwe mwanya, eroranagia na
mawera rna ando oothe, kana ando a nyomba emwe. Ngai
JJ

Facing Mount Kenya
ndegiagiagwo; may literally be translated: "God lives in
the heavens and he does not bother with the work or
affairs of one man alone. He looks after the affairs of a
whole people or a homestead group. There is no one man's
religion or sacrifice."
Apart from the official abode of Mwene-Nyaga at KereNyaga on the north, there are minor homes such as Kea-Njahe
(the mountain of the Big Rain) on the East; Kea-Mbiroiro
(the mountain of Clear Sky) on the south; Kea-Nyandarwa
(the mountain of Sleeping Place or Hides) on the west,!
All these are regarded with reverence as great places and
mysteries symbolic of God, Manage na oriro wa Ngai.
The Gikuyu, who has no "temple made with hands,"
selects huge trees, generally Mogumo or motamayo and
MoJ.:oyotrees, which symbolise the mountains. Under these
trees he worships and makes his sacrifices to Mwene-Nyaga.
These sacred trees are regarded
the same manner as most
Christians regard churches-as
the" House of God."
Ngai, who is not visible to mortal eyes, manifests himself
in various ways. The sun, the moon, the stars, rain,
rainbow, lightning and thunder are looked upon as manifestations of his powers.
Moriro na mahinya ma Ngai.
Through these signs he can reveal his love or hatred. For
instance, when there is thunder and lightning it is taken as
a warning to clear the way for Mwene-Nyaga's movements
from one sacred place to another. When a man happens
to be stricken by the lightning it is generally said that he
was so stricken for daring to look upwards to see MweneNyaga stretching himself and cracking his joints in readiness
for his active service to chase away or smash his enemies.
It is taboo to look towards the heavens during a thunderstorm. Children are told by their mothers not to look

in

Religion and Ancestor Worship

237

upwards, but to go indoors. If anyone is lying in bed and
is not asleep, he is very careful not to lie looking up. He
quickly turns to lie upon one side.
In the ordinary way of everyday life there are no
organised prayers or religious ceremonies such as " morning
and evening prayers." So far as people and things go well
and prosper, it is taken fpr granted that God is pleased with
the general behaviour of the people and the welfare of the
country. In this happy state there is no need for prayers.
Indeed they are inadvisable, for Ngai must not needlessly
be bothered. It is only when humans are in real need that
they must approach him, without fear of disturbing him
and incurring his wrath. But when people meet to discuss
public affairs or decide a case, or at public dances, they
offer prayers for protection and guidance.
For linguistic illustrations we may take the fcllowing :
When a man is stricken by lightning it is said Ahehenjetwo
ne korothereria N gai elcenogora egethie komemenda na
lcoingata tho ciayo, literally, "He has been smashed to
smithereens for seeing Ngai in the act of cracking its joints
in readiness to go to smash and chase away its enemies."
The noise of the thunder is believed to be that of Ngai
" cracking" his joints. In the same way it is said that the
lightning is a visible representation of some of God's
weapons which he uses against his enemies. Ngai has no
messengers whom he may, like an earthly chief, send on
ahead to warn people of his coming and to prepare and clear
the way. His approach is foretold only by the sounds of
his own preparations. Thunder is his cracking of his joints,
as a warrior limbering up for action. It is also the noise of
his approach in general, as if drums were being beaten and
horns blown to warn the people of the presence of the
heavenly chief. Further, he uses lightning as a sword to

Facing Mount Kenya
clear his way. He will strike down anything that dare stand
in his way-trees, men, animals-and blast open land by
its means. The thunder is also the noise of his using, or
preparing to use, this weapon. The lightning is the actual
sword of Ngai. The Gikuyu know this by experience, for
they see its works.
Further, in our linguistic illustrations, we have: Ngai
ndegiagiagwo, literally, "Ngai must never be pestered."
This is a saying much used in Gikuyu. It has wide implications. In the first place it implies that even if a terrible
calamity, such as the death of his child, should befall a
man, his attitude must be one of resignation, for the people
know that Ngai gives and has the power to take away.
The man is not left hopeless, for Ngai may restore his losses
-another child may be born to him.
The following is an example of the kind of prayers
offered up at public assemblies:
Korathimithla
I. Ugai kiama kiroiguana.
2. Thaithayai N gai thaaai.
I. Ugai borori uroagirira, na ando maroingeha.
2. Thaithayai N gai thaaai,
I. Ugai ando na mahio marogia uhoro,
2. Thaithayai N gai thaaai.
I. Ugai megonda irogia iro, na ithaka irokiria konora.
2. Thaithayai Ngai thaaai.
The number I in this prayer denotes the lines spoken by
an elder, while the number 2 indicates the responses of an
assembly.
Asking for Blessing
I. Say ye, the elders may have wisdom and speak with
one voice.

Religion and Ancestor Worship

239

Praise ye Ngai. Peace be wi th us.
I. Say ye that the country may have tranquillity and the
people may continue to increase.
2. Praise ye Ngai.
Peace be with us.
I. Say ye that the people and the flocks and the herds
may prosper and be free from illness.
2. Praise ye N gai. Peace be with us.
I. Say ye the fields may bear much fruit and the land
may continue to be fertile.
2. Praise ye Ngai.
Peacebe with us.
These are phrases which are generally used in all public
assemblies in the Gikuyu country.
In prayers of this nature no sacrifice is made, for the
Gikuyu turn to God and offer sacrifice only in serious
matters such as drought or outbreak of an epidemic and
great distress, as with a serious illness. In this case the
Gikuyu, who believes in the law of "give and take"
(Kanya gatune ne mwamokaniro), expect Mwene-Nyaga to
answer their prayers favourably in return for the present
given him in the way of the animal killed for the
sacrifice.
As in the case of other cultures, Gikuyu religious feelings
and practice may well be illustrated by reference to health
and sickness. If a person falls sick or has an injury it is not,
at first, a matter for supernatural treatment.
Ordinary
medical knowledge is applied. If this does.not succeed,
the nature of the case is changed. Then the ancestors are
communicated with. Perhaps with the aid of a diviner it is
found that one of them has been offended. Atonement is
made and the invalid recovers.
Yet even when it is certain that no ancestors remain
offended, the illness may still not yield to the treatment.
Then the father of the family must organise the next appeal
2.

Facing Mount Kenya
-to Ngai himself. He leads his kin in the approach to the
almighty through a sacrifice. But the mortals do not go
thus alone to Ngai. The living and the dead of the family
now together approach the highest Power. This assures
Mwene-Nyaga that the occasion is serious and that the whole
family is indeed at one, having exhausted all other means,
in pleading for his help.
In such a case one of life's greatest crises, death, is either
imminent or possible, so that the essentially religious aspect
of social behaviour comes into prominence.
And the
approach is made by means of a sacrificial ceremony, which
is essential to the form of Gikuyu religion. It is further
instructive to note the case of a man being injured, but not
killed, by lightning. Here is a calamity of a double nature.
The treatment also is twofold. The actual physical injuries
are treated in a practical medical way. But the man was
struck by Ngai, so communication with High God is at
once called for. A sheep is slaughtered in the place where
the lightning came to earth. With its stomach contents the
man is washed for purification. The beast is then offered
to Ngai through sacrifice. The ancestors are not involved,
since the lightning was not their weapon. Yet, since the
religious act is made by the whole properly constituted
family group, they will be present. The living and the
dead of the family will together try to propitiate the god
who, in his wrath has struck down one of their members.
The sacrifice has to soothe him: so that no more of his
anger will come upon that family group.
These two cases, of an ordinary illness and of an injury
by lightning, throw some light on the respective parts
played in the actual lives of the people by Ngai worship,
communion with ancestors, and sacrificial ceremonies.

Religion and Ancestor Worship

241

The Naturistic Aspect
One aspect of Gikuyu religion remains to be indicated.
Inevitably the people are daily and hourly in the most
intimate contact with Nature. We have already seen that
certain natural phenomena, the thunder and lightning, are
regarded as direct manifestations of Ngai and his works.
We shall see later that he controls not only the health and
lives of men and the beasts on whom men depend, but also
the rain and the supply of food which the rain brings from
the soil. Hence all these phenomena of Nature are in some
degree, like thunder, imbued with the spirit of Ngai. Any
description of Gikuyu religion which left these out of
account would be incomplete.
We cannot speak of
" Nature worship" as a department of the religion, but it is
a quality that runs through the whole, vitalising it and
keeping it in constant touch with daily need and emotions.

Priesthood
In Gikuyu religion there is no prov1S1on for official
priesthood, nor is there any religious preaching. Converting campaigns are, of course, a thing unknown.
This is
due to the fact that the religion is interwoven with traditions
and social customs of the people. Thus all members of the
community are automatically considered to have acquired,
during their childhood teachings, all that it is necessary to
know about religion and custom. The duty of imparting
this knowledge to the children is entrusted to the parents,
who are looked upon as the official ministers of both
religious ethics and social customs.
Gikuyu religion can be defined as being based on belief
in a supreme being, Ngai, and on constant communication

Facing Mount Kenya
with Nature. To make use of European terminology, it
might be said that religion in Gikuyu is " State established,"
but it would be even more true to say that Church and
State are one.
The most solemn religious service is that of sacrificing to
Mwene-Nyaga.
This duty and privilege belongs to the
elders. These may be, and often are, chiefs and sub-chiefs,
high political officers; but they perform in the sacrificial
ceremonies simply in their role of elders of various gradings.
Athuri a kiama, i.e. miraculous elders. In this category of
sacrificial elders, some of them are " wise men," or seers
(Morathi, sing.; Arathi, pl.). These men are believed to be
endowed with powers beyond those of ordinary human
beings. They are held to be in direct communication with
Mwene-Nyaga who gives them instructions,generallyduring
their sleep. Mwene- Nyaga assists and directs them in executing their sacred duty. The powers so given, it is said, are
never to be used for personal purposes, but only for the
welfare of the community.
For it is feared that if anyone
dared to misuse such powers, thus acting contrary to
Mwene-Nyaga's instructions, the result would be disaster,
not only to himself but to the whole of his family group.
Mondo konyitwo ne ng' oki ohamwe na rociare rwake, literally,
" defilement befalls a man and his children."
A morathi (and the writer's grandfather, Kongo wa
Magana, was one of them) uses no magic or medicine in
interpreting the messages or instructions given him by
Mwene-Nyaga. He is commanded not to seek earthly aid in
executing his sacred mission. Thus a seer was in a very
delicate position, for while he was in direct communication
with Mwene-Nyaga on the one hand, on the other hand his
life was in danger, especially a beginner's. Unless he had
received messages and instructions from Mwene-Nyaga

Religion and Ancestor Worship

243

repeatedly and was quite sure that he had got them accurately, he dared not deliver them to the people, because if his
prophecy proved to be false he was taken to be a pretender,
and the punishment for an act of this nature was death.
A seer is not in the same category as the witch-doctor
or medicine man (mondo mogo), whose professional duty it
is to help the elders in carrying out certain rites, such as
purification ceremonies, trials by ordeal and healing of
various maladies. The medicine man has no power beyond
his professional duty, which does not carry him into teaching of morality or religious ethics, as this duty is entrusted
to the elders in their capacity as parents. Sacrifices, through
which people establish communication with Mwene-Nyaga,
play a very important part in Gikuyu religion.
It is
through these that one can fully understand and appreciate
the significance of Gikuyu religion. We have already seen
that Gikuyu turn to Ngai (God) only when they are in
great need or distress, resulting from such causes as drought
or illness of the people or livestock. Having this as our
basic principle in religious rites and sacrifices, let us now
proceed to describe some of the important sacrifices. In
dealing with these it is necessary to show how and where
these sacred duties are performed and in whose hands the
ri tual lies.
Sacrifice or Prayers for Rain
Sacrifice to Mwene-Nyaga for rain is made if rain fails to
fall at the usual time; when people, after preparing their
fields for planting, see that the rain has failed and that the
drought is prolonged. At this moment of anxiety the elders
of fourth grade (!ciama Ida maturanguru) get together and
summon the seers. The seers (arathi) are asked if they have
received any message or instruction from Mwene-Nyaga in

244

Facing Mount Kenya

connection with the causes of the drought. If no messages
have been received by any of the arathi, they are asked to
go home and report again in the morning if they have been
able to communicate with Mwene-Nyaga.
Next morning
the elders and the arathi meet again to solve the mystery.
At this time some of the arathi may have received
instructions from N gai describing what has made him to
be angry and to act so unkindly as to refuse to bring rain
for his people as usual; and also the message will describe
what sort of animal would be acceptable to Ngai and soothe
his anger.
The animal thus described may be a lamb of a certain
colour-black,
brown, red, or white. After the seers have
given the elders this information the lamb is sought for.
The lamb thus to be sacrificed must be of one colour only;
it must not have any spot or blemish, no matter how small.
The origin of such a lamb is carefully investigated. Great
importance is attached to how the Iamb in question was
originally acquired by the present possessor. The lambs
for sacrifices of this nature must be only those which were
acquired by lawful means; either bought by grain cultivated from rightfully owned land or by honey from a beehive made out of a sacred tree. The possessor of such a
lamb must be a man who is known to be honest and
trustworthy.
He must not be a man who has committed
murder, theft, rape, or had any connection with poison
(witchcraft) or poisoning.
After the lamb is secured the next step is to select participants who are to be entrusted with the offering of the
sacrifice. These must be (I) the elders who have outlived
their more worldly desires and can now be believed to
have only the consideration of the welfare of the community
at heart; (2) if women are to be permitted, they must be

Religion and Ancestor Worship

245

only those who have passed child-bearing age, for they are
considered to be immune from worldly mischief and are now
mothers, not of individuals, but of the community;
(3)
two children, a male and a female. They must not be above
eight years of age. Children under that age are considered pure in heart, mind, and body, and are free from
worldly sins. (The writer had the privilege of participating
in one of these sacrifices for rain, accompanying his grandfather, who was a morathi.)
The next step taken in preparation for the sacrifice to
Mwene-Nyaga is to select a place suitable for offering the
sacrifice. This must be under one of the sacred trees,
mogumo or motamayo. In the writer's district there still
remains one of these, a famous one called' mogumo-wanjathi, under which generations have offered their sacrifices
to Mwene- Nyaga. Many of these trees were cut down when
Europeans took possession of Gikuyu lands.
When all the necessary arrangements have been made, a
day is appointed on which the sacrifice is to be offered.
In this connection a public proclamation is made announcing the date of the ritual ceremony. A notice is given in
advance that after five days and nights have passed, the
sixth day will be the day of communion with Mwene- N yaga,
and that no one will be allowed to make a journey which
will make it necessary for him or her to ford a river or a
stream; that no stranger will be permitted to come in or
depart on that day of communion.
Warriors are not
allowed to dance in a warlike manner on that day, for fear
of a quarrel which might arise out of a dispute at the dance
and result in a fight amongst the warriors, thus defiling the
sacrificial ceremony. Precautions are taken in all districts
concerned to make the sacrificial day peaceful.
The
offering is made in all districts and locations simultaneously.
s

Facing Mount Kenya
Locations are divided by rivers or streams. Thus people
between one river and another are considered to constitute a
sacrificial unit. They have one sacred tree or grove under
which they offer their sacrifice in common.
The elders entrusted with these sacrificial duties are not
allowed to have any sexual intercourse or to sleep in their
wives' huts during the preparation and performance. This
period covers eight nights; six nights before the offering
of the sacrifice and two nights after the sacrifice is offered.
On the eve of the sacrificial ceremony all the elders in
the sacrificial council gather in the homestead of the
leading elder; the lamb and the two children are also
brought in. Here a small quantity of honey-beer is prepared
and kept near the fire to ferment during the night.
Early in the morning the beer is strained and put into a
small ceremonial calabash (kanya ka igongona). At the
same time a ceremonial cow (ng'omheya igongona) is milked
into another small calabash. When this preparation is
completed the elders form a procession; the two €hildren,
the boy carrying the milk calabash and the girl the calabash
containing the honey-beer, are put at the head of the
procession; the lamb, its eyes covered, follows, and then
the elders. Now the procession moves slowly towards the
sacred tree (moti wa Ngai or mati wa igongona), which
means" God's tree," or " ritual tree."
When the procession reaches the base of the sacred tree
the leading elder takes from the children the two calabashes.
He raises his hands, holding the calabashes, towards
Kere-Nyaga and, standing in this position, he utters prayers
to Mwene-Nyaga in these words:
" Gethuuri wee uikaraga iguru ria Kere-Nyaga-wee
wenyenyagza irema, na ukaiyuria njuue, togokohakera

Religion and Ancestor Worship

igongona reere otuurerie mbura. Ando na dana ne

Togogokongoera ota oria ndemi na mathathi magokongoagira 0 motelne oyo no kamoireria mbura, Togogothaltha
wetekere igongona reere riito na oturerie mbura ya Keguni.
Thaai thathaiyai Ngai thaaai."
Literal translation:
"Reverend Elder (God) who lives on Kere-Nyaga.
You who make mountains tremble and rivers flood;
we offer to you this sacrifice that you may bring us rain.
People and children are crying; sheep, goats, and cattle
(flocks and herds) are crying. Mwene-Nyaga, we beseech
you, with the blood and fat of this lamb which we are
going to sacrifice to you. Refined honey and milk we
have brought for you. We praise you in the same way as
our forefathers (ndemi na mathathi) used to praise you
under this very same tree, and you heard them and
brought them rain. We beseech you to accept this, our
sacrifice, and bring us rain of prosperity."
(Chorus or
response): .. Peace, we beseech you, Ngai, peace be with
us."
The chorus is chanted by the elders after each sentence. The
tone used in this connection is of a ritual character used
only in solemn ceremonies.
After this the leading elder lowers his hands and sips
the liquid from the two calabashes. This is to prove to
Mwene-Nyaga that the calabashes contained nothing harmful
or unworthy, and that the sacrifice is offered in good
faith. For Gikuyu custom requires that anyone giving food
or drink to another should taste it first to prove his sincerity;

Facing M aunt Kenya
and, therefore, when offering sacrifice to God (who is
regarded as the Great Elder) this custom must be adhered
to, or else he will be displeased.
The liquid thus sipped is spat over the right and left
shoulders to feed the ancestral spirits who are the keepers
of the Tree of God, and who are at this moment in the
procession guiding the elders.
When the preliminary ceremony is completed, the
procession goes round the sacred tree seven times, moving
from right to left, and, at the same time, sprinkling the
milk and honey-beer around the trunk of the sacred tree.
On the eighth time round they sit down in a circle; the
lamb is spread on its back, the head facing Kere-Nyaga. It
is then strangled. The children place their little thumbs on
the lamb's throat while one of the elders does the strangling.
The children's thumbs are considered as a symbol to signify
that the lamb has been killed with undefiled hands.
While some of the elders are skinning the carcass some
are collecting sacred leaves and firewood;
others are
engaged in drilling fire. This fire is made by friction
between two sticks cut from the sacred tree. A big fire is
made on which the meat is to be roasted. The blood of the
Iamb is put into the calabash which formerly contained the
milk, the mutton-fat is melted and poured into the calabash
in which the honey-beer has been carried. After a careful
evisceration of the carcass the intestines are taken out and
tied round the tree; then the fat and the blood are poured
on it. When the meat is roasted it is laid on the leaves and
the twigs already collected and, before the feast is begun,
small pieces of meat are cut from all joints. The tasting is
done in the manner already described. The small pieces of
meat are put together in one heap as Mwene- Nyaga' s portion;
the rest is consumed by the elders and the two children.

Religion and Ancestor Worship

249

When they finish feasting, the heap of the small pieces of
meat and all the bones are collected together and. put on the
fire, together with some leaves and twigs of sweet-scented
wood. While these are burning and the smoke is going up
towards the sky, the elders rise and begin to chant a prayer
around the fire. They stand up with their hands held aloft
and their heads lifted towards Kere- N yaga in the north.
In a few minutes they turn right, towards Kea-Njahe in the
east, and then towards Kea-Mbiroiro in the south, and
Kea-Nyandarwa in the west, finishing towards the north
where they started. They do this seven times, and on the
eighth the procession is formed homeward.
On leaving
they take with them a small quantity of the contents of the
lamb's stomach, to be used in a planting ceremony. This
completes the procedure in the ceremony for the sacrifice of
rain.
In the case of the ceremony in which I took part I well
remember that our prayers were quickly answered, for even
before the sacred fires had ceased to burn, torrential rain
came upon us. We were soaked, and it will not be easy
for me to forget the walk home in the downpour.
When I was older I saw other ceremonies for rain. I
remember four distinctly, but there may have been others.
I had a good opportunity to see them because although I
had, unfortunately, lost the infant purity which enabled me
to take part in the first one, I used to herd the cattle on the
pasture around the sacred tree of my district.
This tree, whose individual name was Mogumo-wa-njathl,
was the sole survivor of the sacred trees in my neighbourhood. It was a huge tree, round which a variety of trees
grew; thus it was an outstanding landmark. The other
sacred trees had been cut down by European planters who
were clearing the newly acquired land for cultivation and

Facing Mount Kenya
were cutting down all trees. Mogumo-wa-njathl owed its
survival to being on unalienated land. Gikuyu Christians,
fired with enthusiasm by their new-found faith, have
spoken about cutting it down, to clear away the" influence
of Satan," to destroy the abodes of the old gods so as to
make room for the new; but the elders have prevented
this, and Mogumo-wa-njathl will for many years yet be a
centre of communion for Ngai and his people. Gikuyu
attachments to such a tree are very intense. It is one of the
key institutions of their culture. It marks at once their
unity as a people, their family integrity (for their fathers
sacrificed around it), their close contact with the soil, the
rain and the rest of Nature, and, to crown all, their most
vital communion with the High God of the tribe.
I wish to put it on record that every rain ceremony that
I have witnessed has been very soon followed by rain. It is
not believed, however, that the rain ceremony must always
be successful. Should it fail, a clearly defined procedure is
ready for use. Enquiry would be made into every detail of
the ceremonial performance and perhaps some omission
found. In any case the whole ritual would be repeated with
special care until eventually rain came.
It is an undisputed fact that rainfall is much less in
Gikuyu than formerly. I myself remember pools in which
a full-grown man could get out of his depth, and in which
we all used to bathe, but which are now replaced by dry
soil. The chief physical reason is, in all probability, the
destruction of the forests. This deforestation followed the
alienation of the Gikuyu lands. It is not unnatural that
the people should link up such a first-class misfortune with
their religious and moral beliefs.
The current explanation heard from the lips of many
people is that Gikuyu harea keari kianoimaho, which means,

Religion and Ancestor Worship

251

" The Gikuyu are no more where they used to be "; that
is to say, " All is confusion." Religious rites and hallowed
traditions are no longer observed by the whole community.
Moral rules are broken with impunity, for in place of unified
tribal morality there is now, as anthropological readers will
be well aware, a welter of disturbing influences, rules and
sanctions, whose net result is only that a Gikuyu does not
know what he mayor may not, ought or ought not, to do
or believe, but which leaves him in no doubt at all about
having broken the original morality of his people. The
rules of hospitality and kinship are disregarded, commercialisation of tribal mutual assistance institutions is becoming
more and more pronounced every day. Hence it is no wonder
that Mwene-Nyaga does not bless his people with rain and
prosperity as of old. The older generation attribute this
lack of blessing to the behaviour of the younger generation
who, as they say, have become individualised and selfish
and have turned away from Mwene-Nyaga's guidance.
There are two more definite aspects or expressions of this
belief. In the first place the tribe has lost its unity; hence
it cannot speak with Mwene-Nyaga with its full contingent
of voices. That being so, he is not impressed. Further, the
people have to some extent lost touch with their ancestral
spirits; hence those cannot so effectively join in the appeals
to the god. The loss of the tribal unity is perhaps exemplified in the fact that formerly all the Gikuyu, with no
exceptions whatever, believed in Mwene-Nyaga. It was a
religion of tribal unity and helped to consolidate tribal
organisation, both spiritually and materially. Now part
of the people are Christians, Moslems, or merely
" detribalised," having no religion at all.
In the second place Gikuyu religion was based on the
active supplication of the family. Now even a single family

Facing Mount Kenya
may well have members among all the competing religions
and sects. The breaking of family ties, kinship, and tribal
grouping, has to some extent weakened the material and
spiritual forces in the community. Thus their degr~e"~(
spiritual integration in communion with Mwene-Nyaga on
the one hand, and with the ancestral spirits on the other, is
rendered somewhat inadequate.
The Planting Ceremony
When the rain, so anxiously awaited, has fallen, the
elders of the sacrificialcouncil (athuri a igongona) immediately arrange for a short planting ceremony. This is to
bless the seeds in order to ensure good crops.
The first step taken in performing this ceremony is to
secure various seeds of prominent crops of the season,
namely, millet, tree peas (njogo), njahe (a very valuable
Gikuyu bean, especially for mothers after giving birth),
maize, and a variety of beans. These, together with the
contents of the stomach of the lamb which has been
sacrificed, are put into seed-calabashes(1cegeena,pl. igeena).
They are then handed over to one of the women who are
qualified for the position of the" Mother" of the community. The woman keeps the seeds in her hut, where they
remain for one night before planting.
The next step is to select two sticks amongst those on
which the meat for sacrifice was roasted. The way in
which the sticks resisted fire determines the ones to be
used. They are sharpened at one end only for planting.
The sticks, which we will now call moro, pl. mero (diggingsticks), are given to the children who participated in the
sacrifice for rain. The children, with their digging-sticks,
spend the night in the hut where the seeds are kept.

Religion and Ancestor Worship

253

Early in the morning the elders, who also spent the night
in the hut, call the children to open the door, so as to be the
first to go out of the hut, and then re-enter, and thus bring
good luck for the planting journey. The custom of selecting who is to enter or go out from a hut first thing in the
morning is very strong amongst the Gikuyu. For this is
believed to bring good or ill luck. Almost every household
has its favourite, moroki wa mocie, or nyoni ya monyaka
(" One who opens the door in the morning," or " A lucky
bird" ); no one else must call first thing in the morning
except the person chosen.
After these preliminary arrangements are completed the
leading elder, the woman, and the two children start out to
a selected field where the first seeds of the season are to be
planted. On their journey there no one is allowed to speak
to them or touch them, for fear that someone ritually
unclean may put a bad spell or defilement on their sacred
undertaking. When they arrive in the field the elder takes
the seed calabashes and, standing facing Kere-Nyaga, he
raises his hands, holding one of the calabashes, and in this
position he recites the following prayer:
" Mwene-Nyaga, we otuureirie mbura ya kemera, reu ne

hingo tokwanbia mbeo thi, oirathime noreke iciare fa gikonyi."
(" Mwene-Nyaga, you who have brought us rain of the
season, we are now about to put the seeds in the ground;
bless them and let them bear as many seeds as those of

gekonyi.")
The gekonyi is a very prolific creeper.
After recitation of this prayer the elder takes out some
seeds and hands them to the woman. She then gives a few
to each child, who plants them, breaking the ground with
the ritually clean digging-stick.
The form of the stick is

2)4

Facing Mount Kenya

clearly defined. It is from the sacred tree; it was used in
roasting the sacrifice; it resisted the fire; it was sharpened
with the sacrificial knife used only for skinning the animals;
finally, it was kept overnight in the care of the pure young
children, and is now applied to the earth by one of them.
It is not used again until the first weeding of the sacred
seeds. In the meantime it is carefully kept with the other
ceremonial objects. In outward appearance it may be
exactly like other digging-sticks, but taken in its full
context, it is completely unlike them, and is adapted very
specially to its unique function. The same procedure of
reciting the prayer and handing over the seeds is repeated
till all the different seeds have been ritually planted.
At the end of the ceremony the party returns to the
homestead.
Here a horn of the planting ceremony is
sounded; this announces that the planting ceremony has
been completed, and the people can now proceed in planting
their fields. This ceremony is now becoming less pronounced in some districts, especially where Christians are
in the majority. Here the system of passing words from
mouth to mouth has replaced the sounding of ceremonial
horns. This method was adopted when a large number
of Gikuyu people, including my own father, were prosecuted and punished for being in possession of any ceremonial objects, which the authorities assumed to be
"witchcraft."
In order to protect themselves from these
prosecutions and punishments, the people resorted to the
system we have described.

The Ceremony of Purifying the Crops
The ceremony is performed about two or three moons
after the planting of the seeds. During this time there has

Religion and Ancestor Worship

255

been weeding and the crops have been tended. Now they
have begun to bear fruits. It is now that the elders meet
and prepare for the ceremony which purifies the fields. To
ensure a good harvest the plants must be protected from
insects. The most essential feature of this ceremony is a
lamb, in securing which the elders follow the same procedure
as that already described in the previous pages dealing with
the sacrifice for rain. The elders who participate in the
purification ceremony are the same ones who offered the
sacrifice to Mwene-Nyaga. Sometimes they are replaced by
other elders of the same grade. This time the children do
not take part in the actual ceremony.
When all the preliminary preparations have been made, a
place is selected in the centre of the district. This must be
a place where planted fields are numerous and where a sacred
grove is in existence. The articles necessary for this ceremony are: (I) the lamb; (2) makori (a herb believed to
have a fertilising substance, and whose smell, when burned,
acts as a protection against insects); (3) mokenia (a herb,
the smell of which gives pleasure); (4) mokengeria and
mohoroha (herbs for maintaining peace). Apart from these
there is a variety of herbs used in connection with rituals,
but the above-mentioned are the central part of the ceremony.
When the arrangements are completed, the elders leave
the homestead to go to the place where the ceremony is to
be performed. The lamb is killed by strangling. After the
carcass is skinned, the stomach and intestines "are taken out,
for these are very important in this ceremony. The contents of the stomach are carefully emptied into a calabash
plate and mixed with herbs which have been cut into small
pieces. The fire is made, wood and twigs from sacrificial
trees are put on it and allowed to burn down; then the
meat, supported by a " grill" of crossed sticks, is roasted

Facing Mount Kenya
over the embers. The elders partake of the feast, reciting
ritual songs, but there are no musical instruments or dancing.
In all Gikuyu solemn sacrifices, rituals and ceremonies
dedicated to Mwene-Nyaga, dancing is ruled out altogether;
as we have already seen, the participants in these are old
men, women, and small children. No musical instruments
are used, excepting a ceremonial horn which is used in
some cases. The horn thus used is for making ceremonial
announcements and not for any other purposes.
When the elders have finished feasting, wood and herbs
are added to the fire, together with the bones, hoofs, a
little blood and contents of the lamb's stomach. These
cause the fire to produce huge clouds of smoke. At this
juncture the elders prepare torches, by tying together twigs
of a shrub called motei. These torches are lighted from the
ceremonial fire. The elders divide themselves into four
groups, each carrying a torch and a small quantity of the
contents of the stomach (taatha),bloodand mutton-fat. Then
they march in four directions-east,
north, west, and south.
The sacrificial fire is thus carried by the elders to spread in
all districts and locations. The field owners prepare dry
grass and twigs in their fields and wait eagerly to receive
the purifying flame for their crops. As the elders pass by,
they transfer die fire on to those inflammable substances.
By these means the purification fire is spread very rapidly,
and in a short space of time almost every field has been
supplied with the flame.
The fire is carried not only to the fields but to the
homesteads as well. The old home fires are extinguished
and the new ones lighted from the sacred torches. These
new fires are carefully guarded; they must not die until
they, in their turn, are replaced by the sacred fire of the
next season.

The Harvesting Ceremony
When the crops have ripened and are almost ready for
harvest, it is time to offer a sacrifice to Mwene-Nyaga for
his generous gift of rain which has now brought prosperity
to the community.
The elders of the ceremonial council,
including seers and diviners, whom we may call high
priests, meet to decide what will be most acceptable to the
deity. The sacrifice of this nature is practically always a
lamb, and its colour is determined by the colour most
prevalent in the maize cobs about to be harvested. If in
the majority of maize fields it is found that the mixture of
white and chocolate, or black and yellow, is most prominent,
the elders will decide that a lamb of those colours is the
one for the occasion. Much trouble will often be taken to
find precisely the animal most desired. Sometimes it will
have to have one spot of a certain colour on its forehead
or navel, or it may have to have the two desired colours
(say black and yellow) equally spread over its body.
When finally the animal decided upon is secured, a day
is appointed for the thanksgiving ceremony. Before the day
of the ceremony, temporary granaries are erected on the
most popular main roads leading to the cultivated fields.
These small granaries are of a ritual character and
play an important part in the ceremony, as we shall see
later.
Early in the morning of the ceremonial day the elders take
the lamb and other ritual objects to a tree called mokoyo
(fig tree), under which the sacrifice is offered. The mokoyo
tree has a special significance for the Gikuyu people. It
might even be suggested that the name of the people is
derived from that of the tree, e.g. mokoyo, the tree;
mogekoyo, a Gikuyu person.

Facing Mount Kenya
When the lamb is ritually killed, the hark of the tree
is then pierced and a piece peeled off. Sap comes, and it
appears to be reddish and white-cream. The pieces of the
bark, and sap, and the contents of the lamb's stomach are
now mixed together. The leading elder then proceeds with
the ritual of cutting the lamb's skin into small ribbons.
These are carefully counted, for they must make an even
number. They are then dipped in the mixture. This is
divided into small quantities and wrapped in ceremonial
leaves (mathakwa). After this the elders stand facing KereNyaga and then, in ritual voices, they recite a prayer in the
following words:
" Mwene-Nyaga, wee otuureerie mbura no gatche kemera
leeega,reke kerende kerie irio cia kemera gelee ngiri. Menya
ogatorehere itwanda. Torigitere morimo wa ando kana wa
mahio maito. Tumumia tho ciuo ciothe, negetha torire
kemera geke twegangareete.
Thaai thathaiyai Ngai
thaai:"

Which means :
" Mwene-Nyaga, you who have brought us rain and
have given us a good harvest, let people eat grain of this
harvest calmly and peacefully. Do not bring us any
surprise or depression. Guard us against illness of people
or our herds and flocks; so that we may enjoy this
season's harvest in tranquillity.
(Chorus):
Peace,
praise ye, Ngai, peace be with us."
This chorus is repeated and chanted by the elders after
each sentence.
When the prayer is concluded the elders take the parcels
containing ceremonial particles and start off to perform their
ritual duty of purifying the harvest. On all cross-roads,

Religion and Ancestor Worship

259

where many paths cross one another, there a hole is dug
and one of these parcels is buried therein. This is to purify
the harvester's feet while passing through from his homestead to the fields, and again when coming back carrying
the harvested crops. The rest of the ceremonial parcels are
distributed among the community to put in their granaries
before storing their grains.
Now let us for a moment describe the significance and
ritual aspect of the small granaries which are built temporarily on main roads. They are said to belong to
Mwene-Nyaga, for, as we have already stated, Mwene-Nyaga
is addressed as "Reverend Elder," and as such he must
have his own granaries in which his tributes may be
deposited. In order to show gratitude to the deity, everyone
passing by from harvesting must put into the granaries a
few grains of whatever crop he or she has harvested. This
symbolises the Gikuyu custom of " give and take," and,
as Mwene-Nyaga has given the rain to the people, so he is
entitled to be rewarded by a gift of the first crops of the
season. For it is said that without his aid the people could
not have any crops. Thus for a man to fail to pay tribu tes
to his benefactor would be contrary to the established
custom, and would be regarded as shameful and greedy.
The elders of the ceremonial council take a small quantity
of each crop thus deposited and then have them prepared in
various ways according to the ritual ethics. Some are
roasted, some cooked; others, such as millet, are ground
and gruel made out of the flour. The preparation is done
at the leading elder's homestead, where the rest of the
elders of the ceremonial council meet to perform ritual
acts and to partake of the feast. The feast is regarded as
tasting the food and the drink of the crops of the season
which have been given to Mwene-Nyaga; and, in this way,

260

F acing Mount Kenya.

assuring him that there was no defilement in the tributes and
that the people have not given the deity anything that the
elders would hesitate to eat or drink.

The Ceremony of Fighting and Chasing Away Epidemic or
Illness
There is a belief in Gikuyu that illness is carried to the
people by some kind of evil spirits. These are believed to
conceal themselves in the bushes round the homesteads,
and when they want to launch a mass attack on the people
they are carried by winds from one homestead to another.
On these occasions the evil spirits are said to travel during
the day. When a whirlwind is seen in its terrific speed, one
can hear people shouting and abusing vigorously what is
believed to be the mass of evil spirits gathering their forces
for general attack on the people.
On the outbreak of an epidemic or illness, the cause of
which people cannot clearly understand nor find any
effective remedies in their wide range of herbal treatments,
the elders of various grades meet to consult seers and
diviners to find out how they can relieve the people from
their suffering. In this consultation it is reported that
medical aid has failed and that physical force has to be
applied against the enemy. It is then decided that the only
way to get rid of such a malady is to prepare a real fight
with the evil spirits which have so unkindly brought
suffering upon the community. For it is believed that if the
evil spirits are defeated in the battle, not only will they run
away and take with them the illness, but also that they will
be frightened and it will be unlikely that they will in future
dare to bring misery to the people.
It is ritually considered that the evening is the best

Religion and Ancestor Worship

261

time to wage war against the evil spirits. They are then
believed to be round about near the unfortunate homesteads, so as to be able to make records of their victims.
After the consultation of the elders., the day is decided upon
on the evening of which the fight will start against the
unseen creatures. The most favourable moment for the
ritual fight is when the moon comes out, about seven
o'clock in the evening. Following the elders' decision,
notices are sent out by word of mouth announcing the date
of the battle. The news is carried out from homestead to
homestead, from village to village, and from district to
district. In this way the people are told to prepare themselves for the ritual fight and to be in readiness for the
signal. The custom in respect to this ceremony requires
that all members of the community, old and young, should
participate ceremonially in the battle.
On the evening appointed, war horns (coro wa ita, sing. ;
pl. macoro ma ita) are sounded from various centres to
signal the starting of the battle against the malicious spirits.
On hearing the war horns, men, women, and children,
armed with sticks, clubs, and other weapons, rush from
their huts in great excitement. The elders take great care
to see that spears, swords, and knives are not used in this
fight, for it is feared that if the spirits' blood is shed on the
land its uncleanliness might spread defilement which might
cause great calamity in the community.
To avoid misery
and suffering, people are asked to use only blunt weapons.
As soon as the people are ready they come out of their
homesteads and form ceremonial fighting units. They start
beating their sticks together in the rhythm characteristic
of this ritual, and at the same time they shout and scream
furiously, moving slowly towards the river. On the way
down they beat bushes along the side of the paths, and
T

Facing Mount Kenya
examine them carefully to make sure that they do not leave
behind any malicious spirit hiding in these bushes.
In all districts, during the time of this ceremony, one
hears nothing but human cries and noises of the sticks being
beaten together. The echoes of this tumult run from hill to
hill, and the whole of the affected district has an atmosphere
of great panic. When the people come near the river the
inhabitants from both sides of the river shout and beat the
sticks vigorously.
At this point the war horn is again
sounded from central points. This time it is a signal to tell
all the people to get ready by the river-sides so as to sink
the evil spirits in the river simultaneously.
At the end of the echoes of the first war horns the leaders
of the ceremonial war unit on the one side of the river talks
to the one on the other side, and asks him: "Have you
collected together all the evil spirits with their illness from
your side? "
The other leader answers: "Yes, we have collected them
all, and even those which tried to hide themselves in the
bushes we have dragged them out, and now we have them
all here with their illness messages. Now get ready and let
us throw them into the river."
At this juncture the thunderous cry and the beating of
the sticks are intensified. Again the war horns are sounded,
this time in rhythmic notes, sharp and short, characteristic
of this ceremony. On hearing these, the crowds which
have gathered along the river-sides start to throw their
sticks and clubs in the river, shouting victoriously and
contemptuously, saying: "Evil spirits and your illness,
we have crushed you. We now sink you in the river. Let
the water drive you far away from us. You will go for
ever and never return again."
The sticks thus thrown into the rivers symbolise the

Religion and Ancestor Worship

263

evil spmts and epidemic. When this is completed the
people then beat oft' the dust from their garments and dust
off their feet to make sure that none of the malicious spirits
have been left behind. At the end of the ceremony the
crowds scatter in various directions towards their homesteads. They march on, singing merrily, for they are now
convinced that the enemies have been banished, and thus
the people's minds are free from fear of being attacked by
the epidemic.
On the journey homewards the people are requested by
the leading elders not to look back, for the psychology of the
ritual demands that every vestige of memory of the evil
spirits shall now be cast out from the people's minds.
Next day, early in the morning, mothers are engaged in
the ceremony of shaving small children who were not able
to take part in the battle against the malicious spirits. The
children are shaved in a very peculiar fashion; the hair is
shaved oft' one line running from forehead to the back of
the head, and in another line from one side of the head
to the other, thus forming a sign of the cross on the centre
of the head. It is believed that by so doing, the remnant
of the illness is scraped oft', and that the sight of the children
shaved in this matter will frighten the malicious spirits.
After shaving, the children are washed and then painted
with red ochre.

"Ancestor Worship"

or Communion with Ancestral Spirits

The system of age-grouping in connection with the living
and the dead plays a very important part in the life of the
Gikuyu community.
As a man grows old his prestige increases according to the number of age-grades he has passed.
It is his seniority that makes an elder almost indispensable

Facing Mount Kenya
in the general life of the people. His presence or advice is
sought in all functions. In religious ceremonies, and in
political and social gatherings, the elders hold supreme
authority.
The custom of the people demands that the
elder should be given his due respect and honours, not
only when he is present, but when he is absent. For
instance, if a young man happens to have a ritual feast or a
ceremony during his father's absence, he must invite a
member of his father's age-group to act as a ceremonial
leader, and treat him in every respect as he would his own
father. If a son wrongs his father, he appeases his father's
anger by giving him a sheep or a he-goat and two or three
calabashes of beer; and in this way he holds a communion
with his father and the ancestral spirits who are represented
by the father.
On receiving these gifts the father, before partaking of
the feast, sprinkles on the ground a hornful of the beer to
quench the thirst of the ancestral spirits and at the same
time to appease them. He then blesses the son and declares
that, in agreement with the ancestral spirits, he has forgiven
him. If a son is married and has a homestead of his own, the
father and mother always receive a specific portion of
whatever the son has prepared. If he kills a sheep or a goat,
the tongue and the fleshy portions of the back are reserved
for the parents. If it is beer he has brewed, the father and
the mother have the right to drink the first horn filled from
the fermenting calabash (ndua), and a special calabash is
reserved for the parents. These gifts are given as tribute
and recognition of the parental duties, as advisers and
guardians of the family group. The elder, when holding a
feast or ceremony in his own homestead, gives these tributes
to the ancestral spirits in the same manner and with the
same respect as he himself receives them from his living son.

Religion and Ancestor Worship

265

An elder in a community renders his services freely. He
receives no remuneration in the way of a salary, but helps
the community with his advice and experience in the same
way as he directs the management of his own homestead
and family group.
In recognition of these services he
receives public tributes ceremonially, and is regarded
specifically as the father and officiating priest of the
community.
The function of an elder, both in his own family group
and in the community, is one of harmonising the activities
of various groups, living and departed. In his capacity of
mediator his family group and community in general respect
him for his seniority and wisdom, and he, in turn, respects
the seniority of the ancestral spirits. This is because he
realises that his present elevated position is due to the care
and guidance rendered him by his departed ancestors, and
whatever he gives them, he gives them not in form of a
prayer, but in gratitude 'and to hold their memory green.
Having this in mind, we can now proceed to discuss what
is generally called" ancestor worship."
In this account I
shall not use that term, because from practical experience I
do not believe that the Gikuyu worship their ancestors.
They hold communion with them, but their attitude towards
them is not at all to be compared with their attitude to the
deity who is truly worshipped.
To clarify this point I
shall therefore use the term " communion with ancestors."
The ceremony of communing with ancestral spirits is
closely associated with the everyday life of an African, for
it brings back to him -the memory and glory of his forefathers. It is hard to say whether this can be compared with
the ceremony practised in European communities in connection with the graves of their "unknown warriors."
There appears to be some such communion with ancestors

Facing Mount Kenya
when a European family, on special occasions, has an empty
chair, the seat of a dead member, at table during a meal.
This custom might be closely equated with Gikuyu
behaviour in this respect.
The Gikuyu, the Masai, and Wakamba, whom the writer
knows best, have clear and definite terms which differentiate
the ceremonies of communing with the ancestors' spirits
from those directed to the Supreme Being. The words
" prayer" and" worship," gothaithaiya, goikia-mokoigoro,
are never used in dealing with the ancestors' spirits. These
words are reserved for solemn rituals and sacrifices directed
to the power of the unseen.
The gifts which an elder gives to the ancestors' spirits,
as when a sheep is sacrificed to them, and which perhaps
seem to an outsider to be prayers directed to the ancestors,
are nothing but the tributes symbolising the gifts which
the departed elders would have received had they been
alive, and which the living elders now receive.
The Gikuyu believe that the spirits of the dead, like
living human beings, can be pleased or displeased by the
behaviour of an individual or a family group, or an agegroup. In order to establish a good relation between the
two worlds the ceremony of communing with the ancestral
spirits is observed constantly.
The ancestral spirits can act individually or collectively.
There are three main recognised groups in the spirit world:
(I) The spirits of the father or mother (ngoma cia aciari),
which communicate directly with the living children and
which can advise or reproach the children in the same way
as they did during their lifetime; (2) clan spirits (ngoma cia
moherega), which have an interest in the welfare and
prosperity of the clan. They act collectively in accordance
with the living clan, administering justice according to the

Religion and Ancestor Worship

267

behaviour of the clan or any of its members; (3) age-group
spirits (ngoma cia riika). These are concerned with the
activities of their particular age-groups.
This group, in
other words, can be called tribal spirits, for it is the agegroup which unifies the whole tribe. It is the spirits of this
group which enter into tribal affairs.
The three groups of the spirits, composed of young and
old men, women, and children in their respective age-groups
are joined in a wider group. This grouping corresponds to
a tribal organisation of the spirit world. It directs its
activities to the more important matters of the tribe; it is
not interested in individuals, for the behaviour of an
individual is dealt with by the members of the groups which
are closely related to that particular individual.
When misfortune or illness befalls a homestead or a
member of a family group, the service of a medicine man
(mondo-mogo) is sought, in order to ascertain the cause,
which is almost invariably assumed to be the work of a
spirit or spirits. The mondo-mogo is asked to make some
divination by the casting of lots, so as to find out what
spirit or spirits are responsible.
When the mondo-mogo
finds out the particular spirit he proceeds then to find what
reason caused it to act in such an unfriendly way; also,
what the spirit would accept to appease its anger and thus
restore the individual to health. The cause of the anger
may be that the family have had a feast in which they forgot
the departed by not inviting them or giving them their
share. In this case, if the feast in question consisted of a
sheep or a goat which was killed for food, and a beerdrinking party, the same feast has to be repeated in a lesser
degree to symbolise the one already passed. The spirits so
offended would be invited and offered the feast, and asked
to communicate with and resume friendly relations with the

268

Facing Mount Kenya

living family or individuals. The spirits thus invited would
generally appear in the form of mongoose or hawk and
partake of the feast provided for them. The elder concerned with the offering conceals himself near the spot
where the spirit's feast has been carefully laid. This is in
order to enable him to watch the character and the mood
of the spirits which join in the feast. This helps the elder
to form some judgment as to whether the spirits have
really enjoyed the feast or not. It is like apologising to a
friend who has been slighted; the spirits, according to
Gikuyu belief, require the same courtesies that are due to
living members of the community.
The relation between
living and dead, established in the manner described, can
hardly be called a "worship"
or "prayer,"
but only
communion between living and dead.

CHAPTER

XI

The New Religion in East Africa

D

URING the last fifty years various religious sects
have appeared in many parts of Africa. The most
popular and one which conforms with the African
secret societies is Ethiopianism, which has a strong hold
in South Africa, and which is well known by the name
of the" Watch-Tower Movement." The growth of these
new religious cults can be attributed to the following
facts:
In the early days of European colonisation many white
men, especially missionaries, landed in Africa with preconceived ideas of what they would find there and how they
would deal with the situation. As far as religion was
concerned the African was regarded as a clean slate on which
anything could be written.
He was supposed to take
wholeheartedly all religious dogmas of the white man and
keep them sacred and unchallenged, no matter how alien
to the African mode of life. The Europeans based their
assumption on the conviction that everything that the
African did or thought was evil. The missionaries endeavoured to rescue the depraved souls of the Africans from
the" eternal fire "; they set out to uproot the African, body
and soul, from his old customs and beliefs, put him in a class
26g

Facing Mount Kenya
by himself, with all his tribal traditions shattered and his
institutions trampled upon. The African, after having been
detached from his family and tribe, was expected to follow
the white man's religion without questioning whether it
was suited for his condition of life or not.
Since the coming of the m{ungu (European) to the
present day the study of African religious customs and
beliefs has not been considered as essential. The m{ungu
thought that to deal with simple folks of Africa did not
require the selection of men with good social standing and
better qualifications. We will here let one of the m{ungu
speak for himself; referring to the early colonisation, he
writes: "It was deemed unnecessary for white men to have
any special training before dealing with and being put in
charge of natives. It was a common assumption that work
on the colonies required men of less education than work at
horne, so the colonies became a sort of deMing-house for
failures and worse. This unfortunately applied equally
to the missionary! as to other callings, and until recently it
was the prevalent opinion that the Gospel could be better
preached and interpreted to ignorant and degraded savages
by less intellectual and less educated men. Of course, in
this case the whole line of reasoning was wrong, for the
natives were not as savage and degraded as was supposed,
and anyway, the more difficult they were to deal with,
the better equipped their teachers should have been."
(Seething African Pot, by Daniel Thwaite, p. 3.)
We can see from this that the early teachers of the
Christian religion in Africa did not take into account the
1 ".
• • The European
women missionaries now engaged in
educational work in Uganda only one-third have any professional
training as teachers. Only 20 have received any kind of training,
and of these about 10 are fully certificated." (Report on Higher
Education in East Africa, September 1937, p. 67·)

New Religion
difference between the individualistic aspects embodied in
Christian religion, and the communal life of the African
regulated by customs and traditions handed down from
generation to generation. They failed, too, to realise that
the welfare of the tribes depended on the rigid observance
of these tribal taboos and rights, through which all the
members of a tribe, from kings and chiefs down to the lowest
and most insignificant individual, were bound up as one
organic whole and controlled by an iron-bound code of
duties. The agencies of the Western religious bodies,
when they arrived in Africa, set about to tackle problems
which they were not trained for.
They condemned
customs and beliefs which they could not understand.
Among other things the missionary insisted that the
followers of the Christian faith must accept monogamy as
the foundation of the true Christian religion, and give up
dances, ceremonies, and feasts which are fundamental
principles of the African social structure. Faced with this
acute problem, the African, whose social organisation was
based on polygamy, which harmonised his communal
activities in tribal affairs, set about to look for the evidence
in the Bible. In the holy book the African failed to find
evidence to convince him about the sacredness of monogamy. On the contrary, he found that many of the respected
characters in the Book of God, lhuku ria Ngai (as the Bible
is translated in Gikuyu), are those who have practised
polygamy. On this evidence the African asked for further
enlightenment [rom his missionary teacher, but the missionary ignored all these queries, with the assumption that
the African was only suited to receive what was chosen
for his simple mind, and not ask questions.
The missionary associated polygamy with sexual excess,
and insisted that all those who want salvation of their souls

Facing Mount Kenya
must agree to adopt monogamy. In their attempt to break
down the system of polygamy and other African institutions, they imposed monogamy as a condition of baptism,
and demanded that even those who had more than one wife
must give up all but one. Without complying with this
rule they could not he received in church. This caused a
great confusion, for the African could not understand how
he could drive away his wives and chiidren, especially in a
community where motherhood is looked upon as a religious
duty; the children are regarded as part and parcel, not only
of the father, but of the whole clan (mbari), and without
them the mbari is lost. It was also terribly hard for a woman
to be driven away, and to lose her status in the society
where she is respected as a wife and a mother. However,
the African, having no other choice, superficially agreed to
fulfil those conditions in order to get the little education
which the missionary schools afforded him. The education,
especially reading and writing, was regarded as the white
man's magic, and thus the young men were very eager to
acquire the new magical power; a fact which undoubtedly
had escaped the notice of the Europeans.
The African, faced with these problems and seeing how
his institutions have been shattered, looked again in the
Book of Books. There he found polygamy sanctioned by
the personal practice of great biblical characters. Thereupon he decided that in order to please his Creator, he
would select his Christian names for baptism from among
those characters who had practised polygamy. Thus names
like Solomon, David, Jacob, etc., are most popular, for the
African believed that with names such as these he could
follow the examples of these ancient teachers without
committing any sin. But he was shocked to find the
missionary again condemning him as a sinner for fulfilling

New Religion

273

that which is sanctioned and condoned in the Ibuku ria Nga
( the Bible).
Now, having described the cause which is responsible for
the new religion that has appeared in different forms in
various parts of Africa, we will give a concrete description
of one of these sects which has appeared, and has found
followers among the Gikuyu. This new religious sect is
known as Watu wa Mngu (people of God) or Arathi (in
Gikuyu language which means prophets or seers).
It was in 1929, when a controversy started between the
Gikuyu and the Church of Scotland Mission Gikuyu, which
among other things attacked seriously the custom of clitoridectomy. During this upheaval a large section of people
broke away from the main Christian body and began
to seek other means to satisfy their spiritual hunger
without denouncing their social customs. Apart from religious sentiments, there was a general discontentment about
political and economic affairs of the country, especially about
the land question. At this time people who broke away
from the missionary influence, together with the indigenous
population, began to form their own religious and educational societies. The most popular of these are the Independent Gikuyu schools and Kareng'a schools, which
combine religious and educational activities.
Watu wa Mngu are a group of people who are fundamentally concerned with religious aspects of life. Although
they subscribe to the aims and objects of the other independent Gikuyu societies such as those we have mentioned
above, nevertheless their outlook in life is entirely different
from the rest of the community.
Watu wa Mngu, as their
name signifies, assume the role of holy men, they claim to
have direct communication with Mwene-Nyaga (God).
They claim, too, that Mwene-Nyagahas given them power to

274

Facing Mount Kenya

know the past and present, and to interpret his message to
the community at large, hence their name, Arathi. They
travel widely and in groups. As a demonstration of their
sacred mission they have given up their property and homes;
the members of this sect maintain that: "to own property
is a sin." Everything, they say, belongs to Mwene-Nyaga,
"Indo ciothe ne cia Mwene-Nyaga," and having been chosen
to serve him, they have no need of accumulating wealth.
The groups of the Watu wa Mngu are harmonious, and
consist of men and women. They have their headquarters
in various districts where they have built large temporary
shrines; here they cook, eat, drink, and sleep in common.
Watu wa Mngu have a special characteristic in their
religious ceremonies.
Their prayers are a mixture of
Gikuyu religion and Christian; in these they add something entirely new to both religions. They perform their
religious duties standing in a picturesque manner. In their
prayer to Mwene-Nyaga they hold up their arms to the sky
facing Mount Kenya; and in this position they recite their
prayers, and in doing so they imitate the cries of wild
beasts of prey, such as lion and leopard, and at the same
time they tremble violently. The trembling, they say, is
the sign of the Holy Ghost, Roho Motheru, entering in
them.
While thus possessed with the spirits, they are
transformed from ordinary beings and are in communion
wi th Mwene- N yaga.
In their social intercourse with the rest of the community
they have a very special way of hand-shaking;
they claim
to have physical strength above that of the average man.
They demonstrate tl'l.eir bodily supernatural power in
hand-shaking.
They would hold a man's hand in greeting
and in this way they give a jerking pull, saying thus:
Newageithio ne Roho Motheru, which means:
"The

New Religion
Holy Ghost is greeting you." The members of this religious
sect strongly believe that they are the chosen people of
God to give and interpret his message to the people. They
proclaim that they belong to the lost tribes of Israel.
In travelling, they do not carry food, for they believe
that Mwene-Nyaga (the Lord) will provide them with things
which are necessary for their sustenance.
They sleep
generally under trees, on the hills, and mountain-sides.
Caves provide a good place for resting and meditation.
They hate money and foreign articles. In their preaching
they emphasise the saying that: "Money is the root of all
evils." Some of them have burnt foreign articles and
thrown away all utensils which are of foreign origin.
They preach this doctrine to their followers and tell them
that Mwene-Nyaga is the God of Gikuyu: "Mwene-Nyaga
ne Ngai wa Gikuyu," and has given the Gikuyu good land
with large forests, mountains, hills, and plenty of good
water in rivers and in springs. For this reason they must
not approach their benefactor with articles which are ritually
unclean, for they say emphatically that foreign goods are
full of defilements, and as such they are not fit for sacred
rituals. Having foreign articles around them, they say,
would mean losing their direct communication with
Mwene-Nyaga, and their prophetical power. This attitude
symbolises their strong nationalistic feeling, and the Bible
provides them with many examples, such as: "Ngatha cia
Othamaki ikoima borori wa Afrika, Mbari ya Abaci ne ikirie
kwambararia moko igoro hare Mwene-Nyaga," namely,
" Princes shall come out of Africa, Ethiopia shall soon
stretch out her hands to God."
This quotation has a
deeper meaning and different interpretations among the
Arathi group, for they claim that Mwene-Nyaga has given
them power to interpret the Biblical sayings. As we have

Facing Mount Kenya
seen, the above quotation is the basis for stretching their
arms to the sky while praying.
The miracles performed by Jesus and His Apostles are
some of the inspiring elements, especially the raising of the
dead and the healing of the sick. Watu wa Mngu, being the
chosen people, naturally believe that they possess these
powers, and they go about trying to heal the sick. Sometimes they succeed in doing so, and this gives them more
prestige among the indigenous population.
While Watu wa Mngu believe in certain parts of the Bible,
they also believe in communion with their ancestors. We
have already mentioned thatthe new religion sanctioned polygamy on the ground that several leading personages of the
Bible, Ihuku ria Ngai, as it is called by the Gikuyu (Book of
God), often had many wives without being discredited for
it; on the contrary, they are praised for their good deeds
and wisdom. Watu wa Mngu, therefore, deduced from this
fact that the m{ungu, missionaries, were not interpreting the
Bible correctly, and that they only adopted the system of
monogamy to suit their own ends, and that they wanted to
impose it on the Gikuyu in order to decrease the population
(kohomia rorere). These words go further to suggest that
if the whole tribe were to adopt the system of monogamy
the tribe would gradually be wiped out of existence.
As to communion with ancestors, it was argued that since
the Church recognises the sacredness of saints, who are but
ancestors of the m{ungu, and if the deity can be addressed
by the saints and can listen to their intercessions, it will
be the more likely that the spirits of the Gikuyu ancestors
will act effectively. The Gikuyu ancestral spirits would
have more personal interest in transmitting the prayers
-and needs of their descendants than mere outsiders who
have to deal with requests from different peoples of the

New Religion

277

world. Furthermore, by following the ancestral line the
spirits of the Gikuyu ancestors, who had departed before
the coming of Christianity, would thereby profit by the
transaction, for in providing for the welfare of their descendants they would find the opportunity of maintaining
their contact with the earth.
Watu wa Mngu also include in their new religion most of
the ritualistic points which the missionaries had condemned.
By widening the basis of their religious ceremonies they
were able to get a large hearing, especially among those
who were suffering from spiritual hunger.
At first
this group was looked upon as simply a bunch of lunatics,
and little attention was paid to their activities. However,
after some time the Government began to watch the
activities of the prophets. Some of them were arrested for
agitation and incitement and brought to court. During the
hearing of the case the Arathi would not defend themselves,
they refused to speak on many occasions, and instead, they
chanted their prayers. This was a demonstration against
the foreign institution.
They did this in courts and in
gaols. We will give here a short formula of their prayer:
" Mwene-Nyaga, hinya waku we mbere ya mahinya mothe.
Totongoretlo newe gotire ondo tongetigera.
Newe otoheete hinya wa orathi na uumbori wa maondo
mothe.
Totioe motongoria ongi tiga wee wiki.
Togogokaera otorlnderere magerio-ini ona matondiorwoine ma methemba yothe.
Netooe ate ore 0 hamwe na ithue, ota oria ware 0 hamwe
na maithe maito ma tene.
Twerlgitanetie nawe gotire ondo totangehoota.
Thaaa-i, thathayai Ngai, thaaa-i, thai-tha-a-a-a-i;"
u

Facing Mount Kenya
This formula can be translated to mean:
" 0 Lord, your power is greater than all powers.
Under your leadership we cannot fear anything.
It is you who has given us prophetical power and
has enabled us to foresee and interpret everything.
We know no other leader but you alone.
We beseech you to protect us in all trials and torments.
We know that you are with us, just as you were with
our ancient ancestors.
Under your protection there is nothing that we
cannot overcome.
Peace, praise ye Ngai, peace, peace, peace be with us."
Watu wa Mngu do not indulge in politics, nor do they
belong to any political organisation, they devote their time
to religious activities.
But the Government suspected
them of having planned to defy authority. Some of their
shrines were closed down by the Government, on the
assumption that they were used for secret meetings of a
political character. About the end of 1934 there was a
conflict between a group of Watu wa Mngu and the police in
a place called Ndarugu Forest. During this conflict three
Gikuyu belonging to this sect were killed. In the Government report of this incident it was stated as an excuse for
this atrocity that they were shot by accident, and that they
were preparing for a rebellion. It was also said that Watu
wa Mngu had engaged the Wandorobo blacksmiths to
manufacture war-arrows and spears for a future revolt.
This statement was challenged by the Gikuyu, who
knew closely the activities of Watu wa Mngu, and the fact
that there was no such preparation. Anyhow, what could
bows and arrows do against machine-guns and aeroplanes?
It is true that Watu wa Mngu had adopted bows and arrows

New Religion

279

as a symbol of their fight against the evil spirits, but owing
to the attitude of mtungu towards the African customs, this
fact was not given its due consideration.
It was also stated that very offensive and unedifying
attacks were made, in the name of Christ, on the Christian
neighbours of missionaries. But nothing was done to investigate the religious aspects of this group, to show the connection between it and Christianity on the one hand and Gikuyu
religion on the other. A careful study of a sect of this
nature would have revealed its real African setting.
As far as I know this religious group is still functioning
in various parts of Gikuyu country, but at present it has
little influence with the general population, its appeal being
to such individuals as have been pronounced "sinners"
by the missionaries, and to others who have been cured of
diseases. The sect is still in its infancy, and its future
growth and activities remain to be investigated by
anthropological field-workers.

Magical and Medical Practices

G

KUYU religion, in the wider sense, enters into
magical and herbal practices. In many cases
magical practices and religious rites go hand in
hand, and sometimes it is not easy to separate the two,
especially in dealing with beneficial magical practices.
Apart from herbs used purely for medical purposes, for
curing diseases of both human beings and animals, there are
varieties of herbs used for magical purposes.
We will
first deal categorically with magical practices of various
kinds employed by individuals, groups, families, or the
tribe.
The magic used by the Gikuyu can be classified in the
following order:
r. Charms or protective magic (gethiito).
2. Hate or despising magic (monuunga or roruto],
3. Love magic (manyenye or mareria).
4. Defensive magic (kerigiti, keheenga).
5. Destructive magic, witchcraft (aragi, i.e. poison).
6. Healing magic (kehania, gethiito gia kahuuha marima).
7. Enticing and attracting magic (rothuko).
8. Silencing and surprising magic (ngiria, itwanda).
280

Magical Practices
9. Fertilising magic (mothaiga wa onoru).
Wealth and agricultural magic (mothaiga wa otonga).
I I. Purifying magic (mo1coora, mohoko, or ndahe1cio).

10.

In order to judge the value or the futility of these forms
of magical practices it is necessary to explain in some
detail the way and method in which each is brought
into action, and the influence it has in the life of the
Gikuyu community.

Charm or Protective Magic
The majority of the Gikuyu people carry a charm
(gethiito) in one way or another, according to the particular
danger against which a person wishes to be protected. This
we can definitely call individual magic, and its presence is
considered as a symbol of security in the daily life of the
community. Sometimes charms can be manufactured for a
group, especially a family group, but the use of such charms
is entirely an individual matter except, of course, when the
father of a homestead or an age-group leader-is performing
his magical duties on behalf of the group. If a man is
engaged in hunting or other enterprises he approaches a
professional magician who dispenses the desired magic.
The people respect and have confidence in a magician who
has acquired the profession hereditarily and has gone
through long years of training, at the end of which he has
been initiated into the cult through payment of some sheep
and goats or a cow, according to the amount required by
the magician's initiating secret council.
The hunter, on desiring to possess the magical power,
goes secretly and asks the magician (mothinga wa iihiito,
i.e. manufacturer of charms) to provide him with a charm

Facing Mount Kenya
which will protect him against fierce wild animals and
enemies of all kinds. The magician, whose duty it is to
defend the community from all dangers (moriglti wa
mogwati), proceeds to prescribe magic for his client. He
takes some powders made from various herbs known to
have the magical power, then he mixes these with some
magical particles, and finally puts the required quantity into
a small, narrow horn. While doing this the magician recites
some magical formula, swinging the horn ritually round his
head and then sealing it. The horn is handed to the hunter
with magical instructions as to the use of the charm. On
receiving the charm the hunter gives a small token to the
magician, to indicate that he obtained the charm by lawful
means and that the magician has given it to him in good
faith. When the ritual of giving and receiving is over, the
hunter is instructed to wear the charm on his person and
never to part with it. He is also asked to take the
following oath:
"I promise you faithfully not to reveal the magical
secret to anyone outside the magician's secret council.
From now on I am under the most solemn ties and
engagements of honour, as well as the most religious and
magical vows and protestations, to conceal the secret
formula of the magical power. I shall never sacrifice my
honour or my religion."
(" lVgokwera na mwehetwa monene ate ndikoimhora
hitho ya othingi wa gethiito geeke, kore mondo otare wa
ndundu ya athingi a ithiito. Kuuma reu ngoikara na
mwehetwa
worindereri na muuma wa okamini, negwo
ninderere hitho ya othingi na hinya wa githiito. Ndiri
hingo ngatengora okamini wakwa ona kana mambura
makwa.")

Magical Practices
On entering the forest the hunter takes the magic and,
after passing it over his left shoulder and between his legs
up and down seven times, he utters the following ritual
words:
"Riu
ndemogitere mogwati moothe, gotire nyamo
njoru engenguhereria. Reke mogwati moothe magarorwo ne
meruke eo ndahuhokia na gethiito geke. Nderigita na
gethiio geke ndilconekene tho ona emwe."
Which means:
I am now protected from all dangers. There is no
bad animal which will approach me. Let all dangers be
turned away by the breath which I blow over this charm.
I cover myself with this magical power that no enemy
can see me."
CC

When the hunter completes this ritual he moves in the
forests and jungles with his confidence doubled; on the one
hand he trusts his skill and the power of his spear, bow
and arrows;
on the other hand, his belief in the protective magic strengthens his courage and enables him
to penetrate into the heart of the dense forest, and act
firmly without fear of the unexpected.

Love Magic
There are two kinds of love magic, each of which
serves an important function in the field of love.
There is magic which exerts its power on behalf of the seeker
after the love of many (mareria or monyenye), and the magic
which helps him who seeks the love of one (mothaiga wa
rwenda).

Facing Mount Kenya
Before we go further, it is necessary to give a brief
account of the steps and ceremonies by which these two
elements of love magic are brought into action. Moreria
is considered as a dangerous magic in certain respects, for its
handling involves certain risks in the economic and social
life of the individual. The magician, before performing
the ritual of imparting the magical power of general
attraction and enticement, demands that a man who desires
to possess this power shall in the first place make a declaration and vow to the magical spirits of the ancestors to the
effect that he will devote his life to love. In this declaration
he is asked to denounce property, such as cattle, sheep, and
goats. Instead of these he desires to have as-many girls to
love as he possibly can. When a man has made this
declaration, then and then only can the magician proceed
to perform the ceremony of imparting into the heart of the
love-seeker the power of general attraction and enticement.
After these preliminary questions have been answered
satisfactorily, the magician, carrying his magical bag, leads
the love-seeker into a lonely place. This must be an empty
hole in the ground used by the hyenas as their dwellingplace (oruma-wa-hiti). It is believed that a place of this
nature is the one where the ancestral spirits connected with
this kind of love magic will choose to live. For this reason
the place is selected for the ceremony of initiating a man
into the magical power of attraction and enticement.
When the two arrive at the oruma-wa-hiti the love-seeker
sits down facing the hole; the magician stands with his
hands raised over the head of his client. In this position he
calls aloud for the ancestral spirits: "Ngoma cia ago!
Ngoma cia ago! " (" Magician spirits ! Magician spirits! ").
" .Yolciai ngoro ya mondo oyo okwenda akundia moreria l "
" Take (occupy) the 'heart of this man who wants the

Magical Practices
moreria to be imparted into him "). He repeats this seven
times, at the same time swinging the magical bag over the
love-seeker's head. Then, abruptly, he orders his client to
kneel down and put his head into the hyena's hole. While
the love-seeker is in this position, the magician starts to
beat him rhythmically on the buttocks with the magical
bag; at the same time the magician, in a groaning voice,
asks the following ritual questions:
"Love-seeker, by your free will you swear by the
spirits of love that you will not desire to seek possession
of sheep, goats, or cattle? Your intention is to pursue
gluttonously the art of love, and just as the hyena
devours human flesh you will do likewise in love-making? You swear by the spirits of love that you will not
seek purification or any other magic to counteract the
love magic? You agree that you will spend most of
your time in love-making? "
While the love-seeker is answering these questions the
magician hits him on the buttocks seven times with the
magical bag. He is then asked to stand up, looking skywards. At this juncture the magician, pointing with his
right forefinger tow~rds the sky, declares that:
" Your heart shall be as wide as the sky, you shall have
as many girls to love as there are stars in the heaven."
After this, the magician makes small cuts on all the joints of
his client's body. On these cuts the magic oflove is rubbed
in and thus, as the magicians say, mingles with the blood.
This treatment is followed by a mixture of love magic which
the love-seeker is given to drink to prepare his internal
organs for their future activities in love-making.

286

Facing Mount Kenya

A man thus treated becomes so possessed with the
enticing magical power that he is almost regarded as
dangerous for the community.
Magic of this nature is
rarely used, for people who are known to have taken it are
looked upon with contempt, especially in the men's circle.
They are debarred from holding any important position
in the tribal organisation. The lives of such people generally
end in disaster, because instead of doing something constructive, they spend most of their youth in pursuing
pleasure, the futility of which they do not realise until
they are well over middle-age.
At this time they look
with envious eyes upon the well-developed homes of the
members of their age-groups who have retired from the
active life of warriors.
They themselves are unable to
afford such homes.
Having described the function and the nature of the
extreme love magic, we will now enter the field of the more
popular love magic. This is used only when a man is
desperately in love with someone in particular and has tried
all his personal charm and influence and failed. In this
desperate moment the man turns to magic. If it happens
that there is someone else who is in his way, the first thing
would be to get rid of his opponent, by way of separating
him from the girl he is in love with. To achieve this, the
help of magic of dislike is sought. When he has succeeded
in separating his competitor from his beloved, he proceeds
to procure the love magic and at once starts acting, for the
ground has been prepared.
There are different methods through which the love magic
can be put into action, but all of them require personal
contact with the person to whom the love magic is directed;
without establishing this link, the love magic cannot be
effective.

Magical Practices
Before a magician gives away his love magic he has to
ask the man who requires it if he has any opportunity of
speaking with the girl whose affection he wishes to win,
or if he has any access to her homestead or garden. In the
case of a man who has the opportunity to speak with the
girl he loves the matter is easy. The magician supplies
his client with a root taken out of the tree of love, mote wa
om bani. He is also instructed how to recite correctly the
magical formula in the traditional language of the magicians.
It is very important to acquire the correct use of magical
words and their proper intonations, for the progress in
applying magic effectively depends on uttering these words
in their ritual order.
When finally the man has passed the test which the
magician puts to him, and has now got the weapon which
he has so much desired, he pays the magician his due and
goes away to put his newly acquired magic into practice.
He takes special care to locate the girl with whom he is in
love. On seeing her, he immediately places a piece of the
foot in his mouth and conceals it under his tongue. In this
way he acquires magnetic or hypnotising power. While
he is so possessed he dare not speak to anyone but to the
particular person to whom the love magic has been directed
in its magical formula. On meeting the one he loves, he
directly talks to her and explains frankly what he really
wants. The girl, if the magic is strong (because the
practical use of magic is based on trial and success), agrees
with him and promises to marry him.
Another way of using the love magic, especially when the
application of it verbally is impossible, is to take the magic
into the hut where the girl sleeps. In this case the magic is
put in the fireplace, so that whenever the fire burns, the
smoke will reach the girl's nostrils. This effect will induce

288

Facing Mount Kenya

her to turn her thoughts and love towards the man who
loves her. The magic administered in this way is considered more effective for the reason that it has a direct
contact with the person's external and internal organs.
Another way of bringing the love magic into close quarters
with its desired destination is to sprinkle love magic in
the form of powder ground from the roots and bark of
the mote wa ambani. The powder is sprinkled along
the entrance of the girl's hut, thus bringing the girl's bare
feet into direct contact with the love magic.
If the above procedure fails, an attempt is made to get
hold of something which personally belongs to the girl. It
must be her hair, finger-nails or a piece of ornament. On
this point it is worth while noting that it is a custom
among the Gikuyu to take infini te care in disposing of the
articles just mentioned; they are carefully hidden to avoid
their being used for selfish motives.
When the love-seeker obtains one of these articles it is
tied in a small parcel together with love magic and then
divided into two. One part is worn by the man and the
other half is taken to the girl's sleeping quarters.
To
deliver this is taking a risk, because the magic must be
concealed in the girl's bed. In performing these acts oflove
magic the performer has to recite a magical formula, as
quoted below:
" Love magic, your magnetic and hypnotising power is
great.
You are now in my service and you will act as I shall
direct you.
My faithful servant, go and enter in the heart of So-andso; make her think of nothing else but me, who
love her so tenderly.

Magical Practices
Magnetic power, cause her to dream of my love, join
her thoughts with mine, let her hear my whisper so
that she may come nearer to my bosom.
Oh, magnetic power, I got you through lawful means;
in agreement with the ancestral magical spirits.
Oh, magnetic power, I recite the spells in magical
language; you will not therefore fail to serve me
faithfully."
After this recitation he calls the name of the girl loudly and
starts to address her as though she were listening:
"My beloved, open your heart and get ready to receive
my words of love.
I want you to know that I love you. To me you are
like the rays of the sun, the moon, and the morning
star.
When you hear my words of love you will, I am sure,
give me a positive answer, for there is no room in
my heart for a negative reply.
I have sent you my love magic wrapped in the rays of
the sun. This will manifest my real love to you.
Through the warmth of the morning sun, the magnetic
power will penetrate into your heart. Do not fail
to receive my words of love with an open and
tender heart."
This form of love magic is very popular; it is practised by
almost every tribe in East Africa. The recitation of the
spells may differ here and there, but the essence is fundamentally the same in that particular part of the world.
The writer is happy to say that he had the privilege of
trying one of the spells, and it undoubtedly proved
successful.

Facing Mount Kenya
From personal experience, like that quoted above, and
many more in various branches of magical treatment, it
can be safely said that this is one way of transmitting
thoughts telepathically from one mind to another. Itseems
that, through concentration, the magician or the possessor
of love magic is able to penetrate into the mental mechanism
of the person with whom he desires to establish communication. In this form the magician's suggestions are easily
transmitted by means of vibration to the brain, and thence
to the mind. If the functions and the methods of magic of
this nature are studied carefully and scientifically, it will
most probably be proved that there is something in it
which can be classified as occultism, and, as such, it cannot
be dismissed as merely superstition.

Healing Magic
The Gikuyu have clear ideas as to the nature of diseases
and of the treatment required in various cases.' Some
diseases are due to natural causes, controllable by medicine;
and a wide range of herbs is used for medical purposes.
Other diseases are beyond ordinary control and call for
magical treatment.
Illnesses which seem to defy the wisdom of man arc
attributed to a supernatural power, or to the agency of
ancestral evil spirits. When dealing with them, healing
magic has to be employed, for a magician is believed to
possess the power of second sight. This faculty, it is
believed, enables him to locate the evil spirit or spirits which
are causing the mischief. By invoking the supreme council
of the ancestral magical spirits, and by having communion
with them, the magician is able, through invisible power, to
chase away the evil spirits from their victim.

Magical Practices
The magician's functions include prophecy, purification,
divination, and the curing of sickness, and he is consulted in
all perplexing occasions of life. With the elders of his
age-grade he is the guardian of the ancestral cult, ogo, and
he tells the community when to sacrifice to the ancestral
spirits and gives instructions for carrying out the ritual
ceremonies.
The magician, when summoned to perform a ritual for
magical cure, appears dressed in all his magical attire
suitable for the occasion. The patient, who has been already
informed about the coming of the magician, and who has
also been waiting anxiously to receive blessing from the
supernatural power, is called out. He is seated before
the magician, supported by one of his relatives. After
ihe necessary arrangements for performing the ritual are
completed, the magician takes out the healing magic,
lJithito kia ogo, from his magical bag. He holds it in his
right hand. In his left hand he holds a small bell, rogamhi;
Ihis is very important,
for almost every Gikuyu magician
lias one. It is necessary here to explain the nature of
healing magic. It is put in the horn of a particular animal,
generally ndongoro, or in a small, narrow gourd from six
10 twelve inches.
In one of these articles some magical
particles, believed to have healing power, are put and sealed
Iherein. The rogamhi is made of brass and is considered part
.md parcel not only of the healing magic but of all other
magics. Rogambi is entirely different from all other
(~ikuyu bells; it is easily recognised by its peculiar sound,
which is believed to have power of frightening the evil
xpirits.
With these few remarks we will now proceed to witness
the performance of the healing ritual. Before the magician
proceeds with his actual work of healing, the sick man who

Facing Mount Kenya
is about to be treated is asked to spit on the healing magic or
to lick it. In this way a direct communication with the
ancestral spirits is established through the medium of the
magician. At this juncture the magician starts to chant
the healing ritual with a strong voice and unusual tone and
rhythm, accompanied by the tinkling of the rogambi. At
the same time he swings the magical horn over the head of
his patient. Suddenly, in a mystical state of mind, he stops
chanting and, looking the sick man straight in the face, he
addresses a few words of a magical formula to him, saying:
" Mondo morwaru, njokeete koingata morimo ooyo waku,
ohamwe na ngoma iria ioreheete.
Umbora migiro irea ooe, ona eeria ootoe.
Wethagathage, amu ni okometahika yoothe."
That is:
" Sick man, I have come to chase away your illness. I
will also chase away the evil spirits which have
brought it.
Confess the evils which you know, and also those you
do not know. Prepare yourself, for you are about
to vomit all these evils."
After this, the magician digs a round hole in the ground.
In this he lays a well-prepared banana leaf for ritual purposes.
He then pours in it water which has been kept in a ceremonial gourd, called mhotho ya ndahekio. The magician
puts into the water a carefully prepared herbal compound.
This is believed to contain some magical influence which
will induce the evil spirits to come out. The magician at
once begins to fight the illness. The sick man kneels, facing
the water, as though he was in a state of vomiting. The
magician squats on the other side of the water, facing the

Magical Practices

293

sick man. He dips the healing magic in the water and, in
a magical language, he proceeds to recite the following
spell :

mokoora, ndagolcoora megiro erea e mwere.
ndalcoho1coramegiro erea e mwere.
Ne moniginia, ndaniginora ngoma iria ire mwere,
Taheka, no tahelce wariga iria iriganeire mwere.
Ne mohoroha, ndahorohia morimo orea we mwere."

" Ne

Ne mohoka,

This spell can be translated to mean:
" This is (pointing to the healing magic) a root, I root up
the evils which are in your body.
This is clearing away. I clear away the evils which
are in your body.
This is a weakening. I weaken the evil spirits which
are in your body.
Vomit, and vomit the unknown evils which are concealed in your body.
This is a calming. I calm the illness which is in your
body."
At the end of every sentence the sick man licks the
gethiuo and spits in the water. In doing this he pretends
that he is vomiting by saying: "I vomit the illness and the
evil spirits that are in my body."
When the recital of this spell is completed, the magician
enters into the sick man's hut. He takes with him some
magical leaves, called mokenia and moimha-igoro, in the
case of a man. If it is a woman, different leaves have to be
used, which are called marererna and makohokoho.
The
former mean, as their names signify, happiness and prosperity; the latter stand for fertilising and spreading. With
these leaves the magician sweeps all the corners of the hut.
x

Facing Mount Kenya
While doing this inside the hut by himself, the magician
recites the following spells in a drawling, low voice used
only by magicians:
" Ngohurora nyomba eno, timahuti ngohurora ;
Ngohurora lvlegiro, na ngoma iria ciekonyanetie toturi-ine
tooto,
Ngoma cia ago ne ndeciitangeire, na nekio ngohurora
"
.
mortmo orta werzgtcetrte moct oyo.
Megiro, ngoma ici cia wee, hurorokai ohamwe na
morimo oyo we moci oya ngamoiterere ndia ngiri."
That is:
.. I sweep this hut; it is not the dust that I sweep, I
am sweeping the evils and the evil spirits which
have concealed themselves in these corners.
I have communed with the ancestral spirits of my cult ;
it is with their power and agreement that I am
sweeping away the illness that has surrounded this
homestead.
Defilement, evil spirits, come out together with the
illness that is in this homestead.
I am going to sink you in the deep, silent water."
On reaching the entrance of the hut the magician intensifies
his voice and begins to tinkle his little bell, rogambi. Then,
with a jerking gesture, he takes the dust which he has swept
and, holding it tight in his left hand, he thrusts the dust into
the water, saying in a loud and angry voice:
" Look at these mischief makers. They shall not dare
to approach any homestead again, for they are now going
to be drowned in the' deep, silent water,' ndia ngiri, and
will be driven to the unknown corner of the earth,
meri ya mekongoe."

Magical Practices
He then gives the ritual leaves to the sick man and asks
him to dust his wholebody to make sure that none of these
evil spirits has been left behind. These magical leaves are
then put into the water contained in the banana leaf, in which
the healing magic has been performed.
The magician
asks one of his assistants to take the water, with its contents,
and throw it into a river at a point where it is deep and
silent.
Immediately this is finished the magician orders that the
old fire in the sick man's hut be extinguished and the ashes
removed. He takes out his fire-sticks, geka na gethegethi,
and makes a new fire. This he lights in the hut. He then
calls the sick man and, pointing to the flaming new fire, he
declares that the illness has been cleared away; that the
soul of the sick man has now been brightened like the
flame of the new fire; and that in a few days the sick man
will be in perfect health.
When the magician finishes his declaration he ends the
ceremony by receiving a small token for his magical duty.
The present given at this time may be the skin of a sheep
or a goat or something else, according to the possessions of
the sick man. The proper payment for this function is left
until the man is in good health. Any magician who claims
payment before the sick man is better again is looked upon
with suspicion; for it is said that if a magician knows that
his magic is a good one, he will never hesitate to wait for
Ihe result. It is after a man has been restored to health that
he not only pays the price of treatment, but also pays it with
gratitude.
Following the description of the healing magic given
here, it can be said that this way of curing diseases can be
utributed to the psychological influence of the magical
beliefs on the patient's organism. The suggestions put to

Facing Mount Kenya
him by the magician penetrate to the conscious and unconscious mind. In this way belief in magical power as an
instrument of supernatural healing is intensified.
This
influence helps the sick man, who is in a state of anxiety to be
cured, to create in his mind a picture of perfect health and
avoid mentally seeing the manifestation of disease. I will
venture to say here that treatment of this kind is associated
with what is known in certain European quarters as
" spiritual healing."

Hate or Despising Magic.

Monuunga or Roruta

Magic of this nature is used to destroy a friendship
between two individuals or between a group of people.
Its use is not limited to the field of love-making, but is
extended to other institutions in the community.
The
chief function of monuunga is when a man wishes to establish
a friendship with a man or a woman and he sees that there is
someone who is hampering his progress. He at once seeks
the power of monuunga to assist him in gaining the desired
affection. To achieve this end he has, in the first place, to
smash up the existing friendship. When he has succeeded
in getting his rival out of the way he starts to cultivate the
desired friendship. This is in keeping with a well-known
Gikuyu proverb which says that if you want to have a
good crop, you must dig out well the couch-grass from the
field. Mogonda okegea irio wambaga konawa thangari.
In describing love magic, we saw how a man desperately
in love resorted to magical power to gain the entrance to his
lover's heart. For our example we will now take a busincsman who is faced with competition, which hampers hi:!
popularity in business. If a man is engaged in an enterprise,
say, pottery or ironwork, and he sees that there is another

Magical Practices

297

who is doing the same with better results, his progress is at
once attributed to a superior magic. The unprogressive
one, whose business is declining, at once consults his
magician and demands that the matter be looked into, and
that he should be supplied with a powerful magical substance
to counteract that which has been employed against him.
Then a magician is faced with a situation like this: He puts
all his powers and experience together and starts to work,
[or he knows full well that his reward and popularity depend
on the success of his magic. Before giving his magic, he
reviews the whole situation to make sure that the failure is
110t due to the inefficiency of his client in business, and that
there is a superior magic which is being employed against
him. At the same time the source of such magic has to be
located,
This is done by means of divination.
When this enquiry is completed, the business man is
~iven the magical substance required to protect his business,
On the one hand he has to employ it to entice customers
I()his business, and on the other hand to turn them away
from his competitor.
This action, of course, is the last
resort when the man has tried all his personal influence
and failed. In this desperate moment the man takes it for
granted that there is some power beyond his physical
.ibility which he could not command without the aid of the
lIlagician's mysterious power and the influence of the
:.pirituaI world.

Defensive and Hypnotising Magic.

Itwanda

The hypnotising magic, itwanda, is closely connected
with the protective magic, but itwanda is used for different
luuctions,
Its chief use is in arguments, in court cases,
,llld
other disputes. It is interesting to watch people

Facing Mount Kenya
displaying their hypnotic power, especially in a Gikuyu
criminal or civil court where the defendant, plaintiff,
defending and prosecuting counsel are in possession of
itwanda magic; each employing the magical power and
trying to influence the court for his own good, namely,
that the magnetic power may hypnotise the judges and the
elders and all those connected with the case, and therefore
force them to decide the case in his favour.
Without going into details, it is worth while mentioning
that itwanda has a wide range, and not only that it is used
in the Gikuyu courts, but also that the people use it
in defending themselves in police and other European
courts.
Hypnotising magic can be transmitted to a person or
persons only through the medium of speech or close personal
contact. For fear of being hypnotised, it is not unusual to
see a man refusing to talk to a man against whom he has a
case and leaving their talk to be conducted through a
third party.
This form of magic was formerly used extensively in
tribal warfares, for it was truly believed that by the spell of
this magic the enemy could be put to flight or be paralysed
and destroyed without showing any resistance. A magician
of war had to ensure his position and the confidence of the
general public by leading a successful battle. In this he
was required not only to cast spells against the enemy, hut
also to show his dexterity in handling his spear and shield
and other weapons of war. When a magician had thus
proved himself to possess the qualities required for a
leader, namely, the unification of mental and bodily power
in action, the warriors guarded him jealously, for his
presence on battle-fields was looked upon as a stimulus to
the fighting warriors.

Magical Practices

299

The fundamental rules of this institution are still adhered
to in many parts of Africa, and it is generally found that the
majority of chiefs and other rulers of the African peoples
are magicians in one way or another, especially if they
command the respect and the leadership of the tribal
organisation.
The qualifications for this position require,
from the African's point of view, that the chief must be
brave, courageous, a philosopher, and a seer; that is to
say, to be practically a magician.

Destructive Magic (Witchcraft).

Orogi.

Poison

The most hated and unpopular magic among the Gikuyu
is orogi. The possessor of such magic is looked upon
as a dangerous and destructive individual.
Orogi is used
exclusively for nefarious purposes and, as such, its practice is
against the ethical and moral laws of the community.
In former days, before the advent of the white
man, anyone guilty of the offence of practising orogi was
punished by death. The way in which a morogi was
executed acted as a great warning to other members of the
community.
Before we begin to describe how orogi is
made, we will, in the first place, give the whole description
of the procedure at an execution. Information about this
was handed to me by my grandfather, Kongo wa Magana,
who took part as a leading elder in many of these unhappy
events.
Before a man was executed it had to be proved by
witnesses on oath that he had practised orogi, namely, that
he had killed by poisoning a man, a woman, or a child.
The action was brought before the kiama by the family of
the victim. After the kiama's approval of the grounds for
arrest, the njama ya ita, namely, council of senior warriors,

300

Facing Mount Kenya

are given instructions to go and arrest the accused person
and bring him before the kiama for a trial. In this respect
it was necessary to bring a morogi to the court with all his
magics, had and good, to be exhibited in testifying that the
man was really a (proper) morogi.
Njama took great care to secure good evidence for the
trial; for without strong evidence against the accused a
clash in the community would have been inevitable. In
the first place the morogi and his associates were spied upon,
because it was important to catch him red-handed-that
is,
to arrest him while at work in his secret hiding-places, in a
cave or in a dense forest. It is necessary to mention here
that orogi was never kept or practised in or near a homestead.
Magic of this nature is extremely feared, for not only does
it cause death when it is administered to a person, but its
nearness to a homestead is considered as bringing misery
and suffering which will dog the footsteps of those who
dwell therein. Because of its anti-social character it was,
and still is, practised in the most secret way, whereas other
magics are performed openly and in ways well known to
the community. A magician after handling orogi must go
through a purifying ritual ceremony before he enters his
own homestead, for it is feared that unless he is ceremonially
clean he is liable to bring defilement to his family.
We will now proceed to witness the trial and the execution. When a morogi was arrested he was brought before
the !ciama, together with his orogi. This consisted of many
small horns, calabashes (the size of a small medicine bottle),
and parcels of banana leaves, and sometimes animal bones
are to be found among the orogi carriers. These articles
contained different kinds of poisoning and curing powders.
The latter were a disguise to cover the nefarious motives of
the former. It should be realised that a morogi, in order to

Magical Practices

301

conceal his malicious activities, had to practise as an ordinary
mondo-mogo-namely,
a doctor of Gikuyu medicine.
When the magician was finally brought to trial the kiama
would ask him to taste powder from each horn, calabash, or
parcel, giving him, of course, a few minutes in between,
and at the same time watching carefully the result of each
taste. If the morogi was successful in going through this
practical trial without showing any sign of reluctance,
this was taken as a proof that his medicine and magical
substances were harmless.
The next thing then was to find out if, instead of poisoning people himself, he had employed an agent to act for him.
In this respect he was asked to take an oath, muuma or
koringa thenge, the taking of which, if he was guilty, meant
disaster to his family and kinsmen.
His guilt on this
point was proved either by refusing, for the sake of his
kinsmen, to go through with the oath, or by refusing to
taste some of the powders for fear of taking his own life
in a way certain to make his spirit eternally unhappy and
pernicious, since it is looked upon by the community as
ritually unclean. Should he be guilty his choice is between
losing his own life disgracefully by taking one of the
poisons or producing the extermination of his family and
clan by taking the oath falsely. Or, on the other hand, for
the sake of the continuation of his clan, he would plead
guilty and face the execution boldly.
If the lciama found the morogi to be innocent he was
released, but the njama ya ita kept spying on him for a few
moons. If he was found guilty, the lciama announced the
verdict and imposed the death sentence. At once a day
was appointed for the execution. This took place almost
immediately. All the morogi's relatives were summoned to
appear on the day 'of execution.

Facing Mount Kenya

302

Early in the morning on the day of the event ceremonial
horns were sounded. On hearing these the kiama of the
district formed a procession towards the place selected for
the execution. At this juncture a war horn was blown,
calling the warriors to take the prisoner and follow behind
the kiama's procession. People in the district were also
informed and attended. The place chosen for this purpose
was always away from homesteads, and had to be an open
place which people could see for miles around.
On reaching the place appointed the kiama formed a ring.
Immediately the morogi was brought in under the escort of
the njama ya ita. He was made to stand inside the ring
while preparations for his execution were being made.
First, a small he-goat from the morogi's flock was brought
and handed to him. He was asked to kill it, to symbolise
his own death. At the same time he was asked to declare
that he had not, and would not, at the time of his death,
utter, silently or loudly, curses on anyone ; and that he was
willing to die silently for his wickedness. After the morogi
had completed this, he was given the heart of the goat to
eat and thus brighten his own heart before he was put to
death. Then a short concluding ceremony was performed.
It consisted of mixing the blood of the goat with cow's
milk. This mixture was poured on the morogi's head, and
thence on his whole body. During this act the assembly
stood in dead silence. After a few moments a few verses
of a ritual song were sung, the officiating elder leading the
ceremony.
" Oso-o-kiama-e, morogi ne egocinwo, o-o-o-kiama-e I

The spirit of this ritual song can be translated to mean:
"Harken, elders, the wizard is to be burnt, oh, yes,
elders.
Harken, elders, wizard has no friends or relatives, no
one has sympathy with him. Oh, yes, elders.
Harken, warriors, let morogi be tied with dry banana
leaves,
Oh, yes, warriors.
Harken, warriors, lift up your spears and shields and
say with one voice: Let the wizard be burnt.
Oh, yes, warriors!
Harken, -people of the district, say with one voice that
Morogi has no one to claim him.
Oh, yes, let the morogi be burnt completely.
Harken, the elders, the warriors and the people of the
district agree unanimously that the morogi stands
alone.
Oh, yes, let the morogi be burnt completely.
Let us say with one voice that morogi has no homestead,

Facing Mount Kenya
Oh, yes, let the wizard be burnt completely.
Let us say with one voice that the morogi has no
children,
Oh, yes, let the morogi be burnt completely.
Let us say with one voice that the morogi has no clan,
Oh, yes, let the wizard be burnt completely."
While the elders and the warriors were singing this song
they went round and round, circling the wizard. Everyone
present put a dry banana leaf, itharara, on the condemned
man. At the end of the ritual song the leading elder called
upon one or two of the morogi's dose relatives. They were
asked to tie the banana leaves on their kinsman. By performing this act they signified that the morogi was disowned
by them and by their clan; they handed him over completely to the authorities and, for example, could never
afterwards bring a clai~ for blood money or any compensation on account of losing one of their clansmen. After the
relatives had taken the initial steps and had shown their
willingness to get rid of the morogi, they were helped by
others, and the banana leaves were tied on the morogi from
head to foot. On the top of the banana leaves dry grass
and other inflammable substances were added.
In the meantime ceremonial elders were busy drilling
fire from sacred fire-sticks. Immediately the fire was ready
the morogi was asked to make his will, and at the same time
to confess the names of the men he had killed by poisoning.
After his confession, one of his relatives was given a brand
from the sacred fire and requested to set fire to the morogi.
As soon as the fire was lit the assembly rose and stood at a
little distance with their backs turned to the scene, leaving
the guard who acted as executioner to keep the fire
burning.

Magical Practices
This was one way of getting rid of a morogi and of discouraging others from indulging in the nefarious profession.
Another way was to crucify a morogi at the junction of
main roads, but this method was less used.
When the business was over a ceremonial horn was
blown and the elders formed a procession towards a sacred
grove. Here a ceremony of purification was performed to
provide a ritual cleansing to the assembled public before
they returned home.
Nowadays, even though a morogi be really an undesirable
or dangerous character, he has no fear of this punishment.
For the white man's administration does not usually
differentiate between a purely medical and a ceremonial
doctor (magician) and the nefarious practitioner, morogi,
but all go under the name of "witch-doctors."
All
" doctors" and " seers" of every type, even men who can
do nothing but good, are liable to prosecution. Indeed, it is
now the innocent who suffer. My grandfather was a
" seer," morathi, or " wise man," whose duty it was to give
general advice and foretell the future as far as he could,
especially in connection with the war expeditions.
He
bequeathed his profession, together with some calabashes
which were his insignia, to my father, who, however, did
not practise, since there were no more tribal wars to be
conducted.
But missionaries, aided by Government officials, searched
the homesteads for the " works of the devil." My father's
calabashes were taken as evidence of guilt, and he, with
many others in the same position, served a period of
imprisonment.
Although they preserved these traditional
symbols they had not taken part in any nefarious activities;
it was simply the policy that everything to do with
" magic" was to be stamped out, for the missionaries

306

Facing Mount Kenya

to get rid of" Satan's" influence, and to clear the ground
for their proselytising work.
Up to this point we have followed the description of how
a morogi was dealt with, namely, his trial and execution. It
would be worth our while to know a little of how the orogi
(poison) was, and still is, manufactured. Before we proceed,
let us make it quite clear that orogi is pure and simple poison.
It cannot be confused with magic or miracles; it is deadly
poison in the European sense of the word. I t is manufactured from various poisonous herbs, known by magicians
specialising in that branch of nefarious activities. Some
of these herbs are known to a good number of men and
women in the community;
but the key point of it all,
and one which is jealously guarded, is how to make orogi.
The formula connected with the manufacturing
and
administering of orogi is, strictly speaking, the property of
the arogi (wizards') secret council, njama ya arogi. This
group conduct their business in great secrecy and terror.
Even the members of the group do not know the proper
names of their fellow-members.
They meet very rarely
and even then they go in disguise. They paint their faces
with very black powder (mbiro) and then paint white dots
round their eyes and noses.
While conducting their
business, no member is allowed to wear any clothes. Each
member has his own hiding-place, known only to himself;
it is there that he discards his garment.
Every morogi
goes by himself, and they see one another only at the
appointed place. The isolated behaviour of morogi can be
well illustrated by the well-known Gikuyu proverb which
says: "Ndoire nyiki ta morogi," "i.e, "I live alone like a
wizard."
When the arogi complete their business, everyone departs
alone, taking great care that no one sees or follows him. A

Magical Practices
morogi generally goes a zigzag way~ sometimes going backwards and then forwards so as to confuse anyone who might
try to follow him. All this takes place at the dead hours of
the night when ordinary men and women are sleeping.
The people in a district where such a group of arogi is
known to exist are in such terror that no one dares to speak
about their activities for fear of the consequences which
will follow if the morogi should know that there is someone
who speaks against him.
The substance of orogi consists of burnt ashes, or ground
powder from poisonous herbs and roots. This toxin and
the ritual ingredients go together, because into the toxin a
powder ground from human, animal, and reptile flesh is
mixed. In this form the mixture is ready to fulfil its deadly
purposes. The chief parts of the human or animal body
required for the manufacture of orogi are the following:
genital organs of both male and female, breasts, tongues,
ears, hands and feet, blood, eyes, and noses.
These
articles are extracted from human bodies, the victims of the
magician's work. They keep watch over the persons whom
they have poisoned, to find out when they die and where
their bodies are laid; then they go stealthily at dead of night
and extract the required parts. But from animals and
reptiles the list is enlarged by adding the internal organs
such as heart, kidneys, part of the stomach and intestines,
liver, testicles, and fat. The materials collected in this way
are dried and are then preserved for immediate or future use.
While we maintain that orogi, when administered, acts
strictly as a poison, we cannot help thinking that the
magical aspects of its preparation and administering have
their importance. On the one hand the magic rites dramatise
the preparations, which are accompanied by complicated
ritual forrnulse, and on the other hand the implication of

Facing Mount Kenya
supernatural powers, which the magicians are supposed
to transmit into the herbs or flesh of human beings and
animals through long recitations of magic spells, help to
conceal from the ordinary man the real secret of manufacturing toxin. In this way the trade is regulated, and
carefully restricted in the hands of a few nefarious men
and women.

Conclusion

I

Nconcluding this study it cannot be too strongly
emphasised that the various sides of Gikuyu life here
described are the parts of an integrated culture. No
single part is detachable;
each has its context and is
fully understandable only in relation to the whole. The
reader who has begun at the beginning and read through
will appreciate this for himself, but it is worth while to
point out briefly some of the implications.
The key to this culture is the tribal system, and the bases
of the tribal system are the family group and the age-grades,
which between them shape the character and determine the
outlook of every man, woman, and child in Gikuyu society.
According to Gikuyu ways of thinking, nobody is an
isolated individual. Or rather, his uniqueness is a secondary
fact about him: first and foremost he is several people's
relative and several people's contemporary.
His life is
founded on this fact spiritually and economically, just as
much as biologically;
the work he does every day is
determined by it, and it is the basis of his sense of moral
responsibility and social obligation.
His personal needs,
physical and psychological, are satisfied incidentally while
he plays his part as member of a family group, and cannot
y

309

310

Facing Mount Kenya

be fully satisfied in any other way. The fact that in Gikuyu
language individualism is associated with black magic, and
that a man or woman is honoured by being addressed as
somebody's parent, or sornebody's uncle or aunt, shows
how indispensably kinship is at the root of Gikuyu ideas
of good and evil.
This vital reality of the family group is an important
thing for Europeans to bear in mind, since it underlies the
whole social and economic organisation of the Gikuyu.
It means, for instance, that the authority of the tribe is
different in kind from that of the European national State.
The Gikuyu does not think of his tribe as a group of
individuals organised collectively, for he does not think
of himself as a social unit. It is rather the widening-out
of the family by a natural process of growth and division.
He participates in tribal affairs through belonging to his
family, and his status infhe larger organisation reflects
his status in the family circle. The average European
observer, not being trained in comparative sociology,
takes his own fundamental assumptions for granted without
realising that he is doing so. He thinks of the tribe as if it
must be analogous to the European Sovereign State, and
draws the conclusion that the executive authority for that
sovereignty must be vested in the Chief, as if he were a
Prime Minister or a President.
In doing so he makes a
huge mistake, which makes it impossible for him to enter
into intelligible relations with the Gikuyu people. They
simply do not know where he gets his ideas from, since to
them the family rather than the larger unit is the primary
reality on which power is based.
The visible symbol of this bond of kinship is the family
land, which is the source of livelihood and the field of
labour. In an agricultural community the whole social

Conclusion

3I1

organisation must derive from the land, and without understanding the system on which it is held and worked it will
be impossible to see the meaning of other aspects of life.
In Gikuyu society the system of land tenure can only be
understood by reference to the ties of kinship. It is no
more true to say that the land is collectively owned by
the tribe than thatit is privately owned by the individual.
In relation to the tribe, a man is the owner of his land,
and there is no official and no committee with authority to
deprive him of it or to levy a tax on his produce. But in
so far as there are other people of his own flesh and blood
who depend on that land for their daily bread, he is not
the owner, but a partner, or at the most a trustee for the
others. Since the land is held in trust for the unborn as
well as for the living, and since it represents his partnership
in the common life of generations, he will not lightly take
upon himself to dispose of it. But in so far as he is cultivating a field for the maintenance of himself and his wives and
children, he is the undisputed owner of that field and all
that grows in it. In the same way a woman is the owner
of her land and her hut as far as outside people, even her
husband's other wives, are concerned, and in her management of her property she expresses her initiative as well as
contributing to the family budget. But her ownership is
not irresponsible;
her chief function in the group is the
bringing up of her own children, and it would not occur to
her that the land was hers for any other purpose.
At the same time, since the Gikuyu outlook is essentially
social, there are certain mutual claims which are generally
assumed.
Relatives help and consult one another in
matters of common concern; anyone who is in need will
go to his nearest prosperous kinsman as a matter of course,
and hospitality is taken for granted. These things are a

312

Facing Mount Kenya

matter of good breeding and custom rather than of legal
enactment, but to understand their gradations in detail
would be to understand the real bonds which hold Gikuyu
society together.
Economic life, of course, depends on the land. Certain
things have to be done, some of them collectively and some
of them by individuals, and the stages of life and division
of labour are regulated by these necessities. Traditional
usage has allotted to every person at every age the tasks
best suited to him and the group with whom to work,
and in every collective activity certain jobs are taken over
by men and others by women, while children undertake
the responsibilities for which their strength and experience
are suited. Thus there is no master-and-man relationship
in economic life, and there need be little or no argument
about the division oflabour; people grow up to know what
is expected of them and what are the limits of their
obligations.
For such a complex community life a careful training is
required and the Gikuyu educational system supplies it.
On its technical side it is practical from the earliest years.
The Gikuyu child does not need Montessori exercises or
class-room lessons in manual dexterity, for with plenty of
space to tumble about in, and with older people around him
doing interesting manual jobs, he will naturally learn by
real experiments. There is work for him to do as sqon
as he has acquired the skill to do it properly, and he hardly
distinguishes work from play. As he grows older the agegroup gives him the democratic companionship of equals,
and he learns by competition with other children the
keenness of sense and agility of limb which "Willequip him
for his life, as well as skill in the various operations of
agricultural and pastoral work. He learns these things by

Conclusion
imitation and free exercise, and to some extent at his own
risk, and in doing so he learns how to behave to his seniors
and how to get along with comrades of his own age. And
since there is plenty of necessary activity, of a kind suited
for every age, the steps of his education are not just exercises
for his own improvement, but real contributions to the
needs of the group life.
It is therefore difficult to separate cultural from technical
training, but something must be said about the cultural
side. The Gikuyu child does not go to school to acquire his
tribal education, because he does not need to do so. In the
first place the normal life of the community is a healthy
environment for him to grow and learn in, and the family
scheme has room for him; it is not necessary, either for his
own good or for his parents' convenience, to keep him in a
special sheltered reservation. Secondly, detachment from
the family is no part of the Gikuyu scheme of training.
In a European's life the school is usually the first big
influence which takes him away from his parents and brings
him as an individual into a separate relationship with the
State, but Gikuyu boys and girls do not have to make this
break. They naturally learn their tribal traditions and moral
values from their parents and grandparents, so that they
grow up with a simple family allegiance through which
they come to understand their duties to the rest of the
world. At the same time a great deal of their life and
activity is carried on with their own age-group, through
whom they learn the lessons of equality and co-operation.
By going through their initiation rites together, Gikuyu boys
and girls are given an understanding in common, which
in some ways is like that of Englishmen who graduate from
a coJlege in the same year, though it is much more sacred
and binding, and is a vital element in Gikuyu government.

Facing Mount Kenya
In trying to understand these initiation ceremonies, the
difference should be borne in mind between Gikuyu and
European culture. The latter is mainly literary; every
English child is compelled by law to go through several
years of schooling, after which he is expected to be able to
read at least his Bible, his ballot-paper, and his newspaper,
and thus pick up his social inheritance. The Gikuyu does
not use printed books; instead, his social education is
imparted to him by image and ritual, the rhythm of the
dance and the words of the ceremonial song. For every
stage of life there is an appropriate course of instruction
through these means, and it is made as unforgettably
dramatic as possible.
At adolescence especially, when
boys and girls begin to take their place as responsible
members of the community, it is necessary to impress upon
them exactly what is expected of them in their new station
in life, and what new obligations are imposed on them by
the development of their sexual powers, as well as of their
general mental and physical growth.
Again, sexual practices have to be related to the economic
life of a community.
Children are a social responsibility,
and in agricultural life a man cannot afford a wife and family
until he has a hut and land, and the power to cultivate it.
Therefore, sexual intercourse must be restricted, but for the
individual's health and happiness it must not be altogether
frustrated. On reaching the proper age, the young initiates
are given the benefit of tribal experience and taught how to
strike the right balance. If there are breaches of the code,
or adjustments to be made between one and another, there
is the age-group to take the matter in hand and impress
the young offender with a proper sense of the importance
of public opinion.
Before entering on marriage, they must again be instructed

Conclusion
in the new duties which belong to this new advance in
status. For marriage has two sides; it is a free choice of
one another by the boy and girl, and this side of it is their
own affair. The choice is not a complete leap in the dark,
for the freedom of association and physical intercourse
which has been allowed to them before marriage ought
to have made each of them competent to select a mate with
good judgment. But beyond this, it means the linking of
two families in bonds which are social and economic as
well as biological, and which are, in fact, the connectinglinks of tribal life. The code which regulates the behaviour
of relations by marriage is, therefore, a most important matter
in its bearings on the whole of social life, and has to be very
carefully learnt and punctiliously followed.
Marriage, and especially parenthood, gives a man his
full share in the common happiness and qualifies him to
think for the common good. It is not till he has a son
or daughter entering on adolescence that he is regarded as
really mature enough to take part in the tribal government,
and here again we see that the guiding principles are his
family experience, and the opinion of him which his contemporaries have formed. It is not until he has a family
growing up that he has had a chance to show his capacity
for wise administration and for dealing intelligently and
justly with other people, and what he can do in the family
group he is expected to do on a larger scale in the interests
of the community as a whole. Among his equals in age a
man may he selected as a leader or spokesman by reason of
his innate gifts and understanding, for the age-group system
gives the Gikuyu a good grasp of the principles of democratic selection. If so, he will be marked out by the elders
as one who mil play an important part in public affairs
later on, but not until he has passed successive age-grades

Facing Mount Kenya
and acquired the experience of life which will qualify him
to take full responsibility in tribal matters. By that time
he is probably the leader of almost a miniature tribe of his
own relatives, as well as his age-grade, and his family life
will give evidence of his ability in government.
When we come to religion, we see again that Gikuyu
religion is integrated with the whole of Gikuyu life.
Religion is a dramatisation of belief, and belief is a matter of
social experience of the things that are most significant to
human life. In Gikuyu life the earth is so visibly the mother
of all things animate, and the generations are so closely
linked together by their common participation in the land,
that agricultural ritual, and reverence for ancestral spirits,
must naturally play the foremost part in religious ceremonial.
The new religious movement is interesting because of its
bearing on the question of social change. I t is not reasonable to expect the Gikuyu to assimilate Christianity whole
as the European missionary expounds it. Its language and
its traditions have no relation to his daily life, its ceremony
is meaningless to him, and its moral code, with its insistence
on monogamy for which Gikuyu economy is not planned,
and its objection to the central rituals of his own society,
strikes him as subversive of all intelligible social values.
But the new religious movement does show that Africans,
under the influence of new forces, are not incapable of a
spontaneous adaptation.
It is an effort from within, to
assimilate what seems to them valuable in the Christian
code and the culture of which it is a part, while at the same
time adapting it to the needs of Gikuyu life.
Lastly, we come to magical practices and see how they,
like religion, are inspired by the daily economic and social
activities of the people, and how they run through and
fertilise these activities and refer them to the mysterious

Conclusion

317

forces which surround human life. Even here it is clear
how everything good comes from the collective life of the
community, while the wizard practises his works of darkness
alone. And when a man has been convicted of the capital
crime of anti-social wizardry, his offence is against the
whole of society, but it is one of his own kinsmen who has
to pass final judgment against him by lighting the fire of his
execution.
It is all these different aspects of life together that make
up a social culture. And it is the culture which he inherits
that gives a man his human dignity as well as his material
prosperity. It teaches him his mental and moral values and
makes him feel it worth while to work and fight for liberty.
But a culture has no meaning apart from the social
organisation oflife on which it is built. When the European
comes to the Gikuyu country and robs the people of their
land, he is taking away not only their livelihood, but the
material symbol that holds family and tribe together. In
doing this he gives one blow which cuts away the foundations from the whole of Gikuyu life, social, moral, and
economic. When he explains, to his own satisfaction and
after the most superficial glance at the issues involved, that
he is doing this for the sake of the Africans, to " civilise "
them, " teach them the disciplinary value of regular work,"
and" give them the benefit of European progressive ideas,"
he is adding insult to injury, and need expect to convince
no one but himself.
There certainly are some progressive ideas among the
Europeans. They include the ideas of material prosperity,
of medicine, and hygiene, and literacy which enables people
to take part in world culture. But so far the Europeans
who visit Africa have not been conspicuously zealous in
imparting these parts of their inheritance to the Africans,

Facing Mount Kenya
and seem to think that the only way to do it is by police
discipline and armed force. They speak as if it was somehow beneficial to an African to work for them instead of
for himself, and to make sure that he will receive this benefit
they do their best to take away his land and leave him with
no alternative. Along with his land they rob him of his
government, condemn his religious ideas, and ignore his
fundamental conceptions of justice and morals, all in the
name of civilisation and progress.
If Africans were left in peace on their own lands, Europeans would have to offer them the benefits of white
civilisation in real earnest before they could obtain the
African labour which they want so much. They would
have to offer the African a way of life which was really
superior to the one his fathers lived before him, and a share
in the prosperity given them by their command of science.
They would have to let the African choose what parts of
European culture could be beneficially transplanted, and
how they could be adapted.
He would probably not
choose the gas bomb or the armed police force, but he
might ask for some other things of which he does not get
so much to-day. As it is, by driving him off his ancestral
lands, the Europeans have robbed him of the material
foundations of his culture, and reduced him to a state of
serfdom incompatible with human happiness. The African
is conditioned, by the cultural and social institutions of
centuries, to a freedom of which Europe has little conception, and it is not in his nature to accept serfdom for
ever. He realises that he must fight unceasingly for his own
complete emancipation; for without this he is doomed to
remain the prey of rival imperialisms, which in every
successive year will drive their fangs more deeply into his
vitality and strength.

of their kind ascend to seats of power. With what passion the
souls of thinking men and women were stirred when John F. Kennedy became president. Kennedy, of course, was no intellectual;
but he was the first American president in many years to give the
impression that a book was not an alien object. Also, in fairness to
the Kennedy image, which has become much tarnished in recent
years, it has to be said that at least he had a touching and— for a
president— perhaps unique concern for what intellectuals thought
of him. During one of the two conversations I had with Kennedy
he was gloomily preoccupied, and clearly much hurt, because Alfred Kazin, in an American Scholar article, had belittled his pretensions to a place among the intelligentsia. With real pain, like a
jilted lover, he spoke of Kazin and while his somewhat callow

Francois Mitterrand's
Julio Cortazar of Argentina and Milan Kundera of Czechoslovakia, two exiled writers who had long and vainly petitioned the
preceding administration for the right to become Frenchmen. Mitterrand's act was both symbolic and fraternal— the gesture of a
politician who is also both an intellectual and a literary man. Mitterrand would doubtless object to the latter designation for, as he
tells us in his remarkable book The Wheat and the Chaff, he always
insists upon being called a politician, preferring action to words.

realizes with something akin to shock) prophetic. An uncanny

face of the earth, the Second had dreamt great dreams, the Third
had reestablished national unity. By their radiance, they had compelled the victors to pretend that they took their inspiration from
their principles. The Fourth Republic, which lacked such luster,
died not with a bang but a whimper. It had resorted to an outmoded political system. It had failed to solve the colonial crisis. It
no longer stood for what the ruling class expected from the State.
It was doomed. To be sure, de Gaulle was no more the desired
savior than the two Bonapartes had been. But like them he knew
how to seize the opportunity when the time was ripe and how to
anticipate various conflicting ambitions. The wealthy bourgeoisie,
long accustomed to marriages of reason, accepted the one who
saved the essential. The Fifth Republic had a clear field. Clear?

months later I was informed by Alexandre Parodi that I had, with
the concurrence of Algiers, been named by the government-inexile head of pows, deportees, and refugees in the future administration. It was in this capacity that I participated in the first
plenary session of the Free French Government, presided over by
General de Gaulle, on August 27, 1944. I can still hear the monologue he delivered that day. I listened, I observed, I admired. From
the experience of having lived through various historic moments,
the memory of which tends all too quickly to fade and be forgotten, I have learned to treasure this kind of emotion. But I was

its own decadence, and derived from that source enough strength

differences and joined forces against the other threat, the real one,
the one brewing in the factories and workers' suburbs, among

they who had been taken— their bread had been taken, their freedom, and soon their precarious peace would be stolen, too— and
that knowledge was fueling their increasing anger. In those days I
belonged to neither group. The former— those in power— because I
knew them all too well; the latter, because I didn't know them at
all. But in the absence of knowledge, I was beginning to sense the
truth. Unaware that the current regime was actually in its death
throes, I thought that France was condemned to be forever subjected to the endless round of ministerial crises, pompous rhetoric, and the mediocrity of its political leaders, and I was alarmed
and upset about this dead period in the life of a great people.
Then war broke out. I had seen the officers of my regiment who
in May would die bravely, play poker in April without worrying
about the soldiers under their command who were paying dearly

same majority or to find another majority in the same Assembly, not only would the Left avoid the blackmail-dissolution and
the dissolution by surprise, but would also demonstrate that it
was serious when it declared that it was willing to submit to the
notion of democratic alternation. You will understand the validity
of the Socialist position if you take the present political situation
in Germany and transpose it to France: in Germany, all it would
take for a shift of power from the hands of the Socialists to the
Christian Democrats would be for the Liberal Party to change
the

camps.

legal formalities than the Left proposes when he dissolved the

would appreciate it if Jean-Francois Revel would give me an
example of some regime, assuming it is democratic, where one
can prevent a party from leaving the majority if it so desires. And
if there is no longer a majority within any national assembly, what
regime, assuming it is a parliamentary one, can prevent the people
from going back to the voting booth? The Communist Party, by
aligning itself with the Socialist position on this issue, enabled the
Common Program to guarantee political alternation, increase stability, and preserve the powers of the chief of state in an area

Lyndon Johnson is buried at the precise moment when Richard
Nixon affixes his signature to the peace treaty with Vietnam: history as symbol. The photograph of Henry Kissinger and Le Due
Tho shaking hands on the sidewalk of Avenue Kleber in Paris,
each smiling broadly, acts as counterpoint and shows the capacity
of a world where, suddenly, the long martyrdom of a people appears as nothing more than a bit of vapor on a window. Long live

for a moment on my own months of May, on those people and
situations I remembered because of that month. The phony war,
which on a May 10 ceased to be a laughing matter. The death of
my father on a May 5. Slow to arrive, the night bore him away
just before the first light of day. A May 28, at Courville, on the
road to Chartres, when a friend of mine fell asleep at the wheel
and, going sixty miles an hour, wrapped his car around a linden
tree. Not to mention politics and its craziness on a May 13. There
were also marvelous moments, exquisite pleasures, many happinesses that only a May could bring. Your head buried in the
grass to smell the fresh grass, and breathe in the life rising up
from the reawakened earth. The tulips are still in bloom, though
nearing their end, while the iris still stand proud and purple benefiting from the April showers. The stock, which have taken root
between two stones in the wall, make a far more eloquent case for
the existence of God than do all the priests of Notre Dame. The
May of Rome and the May of Amsterdam mingle their red
ochres. One does not need the presence of the boats on canals to
suffer a case of wanderlust. The city is a sea, with its islands and
currents. A Volkswagen at the door, and there we are! Christopher

Over dinner, my oldest son, Christophe, asked me about the first
meeting between de Gaulle and the people of Paris, at the time of
the Liberation. Here is what I told him.

De Gaulle arrived at the Hotel de Ville, "cold, preoccupied with
new world he was trying to figure out, which he generally
did," as Georges Bidault relates, "much more by closing his eyes

in order to meditate

than by opening his eyes in order to learn."

The top leaders of the Resistance within France were there to
greet him with pomp and circumstance in the second-story salon.
He listened, ill at ease, to Georges Marranne talk about the Resistance, Georges Bidault about the Republic, and his answer was
brief, to say the least. Then an incident occurred which de Gaulle
related in his Memoirs. "As I was preparing to leave," writes de
Gaulle, "Georges Bidault called, 'General! We ask that you solemnly proclaim the existence of the Republic to the people assembled in the square outside/ To which I replied, The Republic

be reassured and that I believed in General Maurin's sincerity.
The temptation of a military coup d'etat faced by a tottering regime always exists, and that is true anywhere in the world. Neither the United States nor Soviet Russia is free from the
possibility of a military takeover.

A

succession of political set-

backs in foreign policy, and therefore a threat to the integrity of
the empire or sphere of influence, the weariness that derives

corruption, political scandal or simply insecurity of the people

goods— however modest they may be— can tear the fabric of even the most firmly established societies. If I were asked
what I really thought, or to rely on my intuition— which, under the
circumstances would be imprudent for someone who is careful
not to make political prophecies— I would venture to say that both
countries in question are open to that possibility.
But that was not what Mr. Mougeotte was referring to. The
parallel he was drawing, however implicitly, was between the end
of Allende's Chile and the issue raised by the publisher of the
French Conservative newspaper, Le Figaro, among others, and
aimed directly and exquisitely at the head of a possible future
Socialist government in France. The debate was by the Socialist
magazine Frontieres, and picked up by General Maurin: Is or is not
the French army in the service of capitalism? On this point, I
haven't the slightest doubt. The army, or more precisely most of
the officers— for that is who the question is aimed at— have no
sense of allegiance toward capitalism as an economic entity based
on the domination of the social class which controls the means of
production. They do not serve money, which they do not have
themselves and to which they do not aspire. The young man who

known, Robert Schuman was the only one whose desk was always clear and who always seemed to have plenty of time to

silence. As one might expect, I love it and fear it. But without it I
lose that subtle sense which allows one to communicate with the
essence of things. Perceptions wear thin very quickly. Three
months in Paris and I can no longer tell the odors of the forest
apart. That is an alarm signal for me. When I am no longer able to
recognize the workings of nature, I am on the verge of forgetting
what makes men tick.

regimental, as though his two interviewers were simple soldiers
and he was the colonel in command. Pierre Messmer likes to
remind us that the period of his life he remembers most fondly
was his time in the Foreign Legion. Seeing him, even hearing him,
makes it eminently clear why. He walks with his good conscience

that goal, mean that, automatically, one is an enemy of the Arabs?
"We have no desire to destroy Israel, and we want peace,"
Sadat answered. The previous evening, Vice President Fawzi and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Fahmi told us much the same thing
with equal conviction. "But Israel must give up the territories occupied in 1967 and recognize the reality of a Palestinian homedid Golda Meir's and

toward a kind of national union, the soul and inspiration for

which remained the revolution.

And

after

all,

they added, was that

not really the ultimate aim of any successful revolution, to reunite
the entire nation?

The supporters of the first thesis stressed the elimination of the
members of the Council of the Revolution, with the exception of
Shafei, from the inner circle of the government; Ali Sabri was in
prison, and Khaled Mohieddin had been stripped of all his functions. They also pointed out that despite the return to government, after five years of prison and with the signs of torture still
visible on his face, of a man like Ismail Sabri Abdallah, the former—and remarkable— leader of the Egyptian Communist Party,
there was still apparently the constant threat hanging over the
intellectuals and militants of the Left, who sometimes were allowed to voice their opinions freely in the narrow circles who read
their little magazines, and were sometimes arrested and thrown
into prison by the Egyptian police.
Those who took the second view used these same arguments to
prove their own point, maintaining that Sadat was employing a
subtle but sure strategy aimed at normalizing the political life of
Egypt, for, they said, with the exception of Ali Sabri and a few
followers, and several Moslem brothers who were still in prison,
repression throughout Egypt had to all intents and purposes
ceased. They also cited the fact that Sadat had announced that he
was allowing the ashes of King Farouk and his sister to be brought
back to Egypt to be interred beside the tombs of their Mameluke
ancestors, showed how deep were the roots of the revolution and
how little it feared the shadow of the monarchy. They added that
Sadat clearly was very much in charge of the situation, that it was
he who was calling the shots, and, having demonstrated his aptitude for leadership, it was finally possible to move the revolution
away from the Nasserian dream toward the practical problems
that Egypt was facing in today's world.
Sadat's behavior during the Yom Kippur War, and the sudden
withdrawal which had followed it, only heightened the dispute.

That Sadat sincerely wanted peace, no one denied. But that he
harbored any

some Sadat-watchers thought they detected in that stance a

were a long one— for the fruit to ripen among the Syrians and

earlier times considered as a moderate and pro-American, because he had acted as a restraint on some of Nasser's more radical

still remain unresolved: how to cool the reactors, and how to get
rid of nuclear wastes. Water pumped from a river, or the sea, to
cool the nuclear core must be pumped back out, but when it
returns to its source it is so hot that it kills all fauna and most
flora. A sudden warming of the water temperature of a lake or
river is enough to kill it. The four nuclear plants planned for the
Bugey region would, once in service, cause the waters of the
Rhone River to rise some thirty degrees for a few deadly days
each year. As for the problem of nuclear wastes, we have already
ceased to bury them on the ocean floor, for it is conceded that the
material in which they are enclosed— be it concrete, lead, or ironare not necessarily one hundred percent watertight. So they are
currently being stocked at a spot near Cherbourg, a site promoted

The following day Karl climbed up on his high wire, balanced

good measure, he kept his perch not for a full day but for a whole

huge margin, Johann, far from applauding his friend's efforts, remained silent. "So," said Karl after an embarrassed pause, "what

call it intuition, that ancient wisdom transmitted from generation

of our genetic code. I do not calculate, I feel. The instrument is
approximate, especially where time is concerned. If I'm off by
twenty years, too bad for me. Change in continuity. Last year this
catch phrase made us smile. The one I was, I am; or rather, to
quote Walt Whitman, I become. I cannot remember much of the
little boy I was save for three or four images which come back
again and again like the repeated notes on a worn record. These
memories are so bright that everything else fades into darkness. A
sunken lane which our family geography had named "the little
hill," the adjective somehow conferring on it a singular dignity; a
path bordered by apple trees crossing a wheat field; a flat-topped

My other aim was to meet the writers I admired (even if, for

ambition went no further than seeing and hearing them— with no

But this denial of death bothers me. I feel that a society which
hides death from the eyes of the living, paints it over like a lie,
removes it from daily awareness, is not magnifying life but corrupting it. Birth and death are the two wings of time. How can

met Mikis Theodorakis at the Continental, a big hotel in
Paris where he was holding a press conference. He had arrived
from Athens, having just been liberated after three years' internment and house arrest. Papadopoulos had decided to let him go
free so as to sidetrack the ministers of the Council of Europe
meeting in Strasbourg to determine whether it was time to make
public the report of the Commission on the Rights of Man concerning the practice of torture by the regime of the Greek colonels. No one will have forgotten the rescue mission organized by
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber which resulted in Mikis' arrival in
France. The day before, I had myself been approached to undertake this mission. But I was at Chateau-Chinon and there had
been delay in contacting me so that I had not been able to charter
a plane at such short notice. On my return to Paris I was informed
that this mission had been successfully accomplished by the ediI

As

his

Untidy curly hair surrounded a face

once drawn and puffy with fatigue. With rapid pas-

sionate words, he talked about Greece; about the brutal stupidity
of the dictators,

and the struggles of the

resistants.

The flow

of

words, the timbre of his voice, emanated from a sense of rhythm

which revealed a familiar music.

The second time

saw him he was playing the piano in a flat in
the Saint-Augustin quarter. There were too many guests for the
very small room. Shoving and standing on tiptoe, people peered
between heads and shoulders to get a glimpse of Mikis. He was
bent over the instrument, his fingers running over the keyboard as
though writing a poem. He played with long silences and that
obstinate concentration which is a form of absence, an inner journey, though at the same time a shortcut for crossing the border
which joins one to the rest of the world, when one knows the way.
Now and then he accompanied himself in a half-muted voice. The
emotion which gripped us all transformed this small crowd into a
single body, animated by the soul of the instant. We were the sun
and the river and the lonely valley; and we were the steps of the
upper town, edged with flowers and blood. We were the devastated gardens and the burning forests. O Greece, O freedom, twofold and unique homeland! We were exile and hope, vine and sea,
the traveler not to be turned away from the path that leads homeward. In

ironically, 'The Italian Communist Party allows its country to

his intentional changes of humor and tone, my host had only one
way of being himself. His capacity for astonishing ended there.
He is always described as being in a hurry, agitated, forever on
the point of rushing off to the other end of the world for a fifteenminute conversation. I think rather that he lives up to this image
of himself as a means of gaining time. Nothing is less doublefaced than his diplomacy. He either charms or attacks. Of course,

"The Germans, the English, the Dutch, to

And yet they are our faithful allies. Whatever form it may take,
we respect the orientation of their internal politics. Their common
denominator is to have no indulgence for communism. We ask
nothing else of our friends." I felt like saying, "Have you never
had any doubts? The West will not be able to resist the power of
attraction of the system against which it fights, until it breaks
away from the system which inspires it." What good would it
have done? could not expect him to condemn a society when his
function was to be its prime defender. As though he had followed
my train of thought, Kissinger changed course and remarked,

Nationalization is not the best solution. First of all you overload
the State machinery, which needs to be adaptable and able to act
quickly. The Italian Communist Giorgio Amendola recently confided to one of our senators that the first task of a government of
"historical compromise" would be to get rid of at least one third
of the present public enterprises, which paralyze the economy of
his country. But that is not the most important factor. Private
enterprise has lost its prestige, what I might call its moral weight,
or better still its mythological power inherited from the great adventure of the nineteenth century. Money for money's sake will
never awaken man's feeling of the sacred. It is permissible for the

wanted to leave Algiers I was on my own. Having
realized this, I wasted no time mulling over the irony of fate. I did
not know the town, nor anyone in it, and what with the wartime
atmosphere I had the feeling I had gotten lost in some dead-end of
the world. To get to London from there was a challenge. But

MONDAY, APRIL 12
The declarations of the Right set out to prove that the Socialist
Party's program betrays the ideas of Jaures and Blum, who have
suddenly become worthy of this bare-faced praise. What this belated eulogy is meant to suggest is only too evident. For my readers' benefit I was curious enough to have a look at the records of
parliamentary debates and press archives of the first half of the
century. It would take a whole volume to reprint the abuse, both
verbal and written, that was heaped upon our models. The bourgeoisie waited till they were dead before honoring these men it
now holds up to us as examples. On occasion, in fact, it was in a
considerable hurry for them to reach that point! Antipatriot, antimilitarist, enemy agent— these accusations are part of the inexhaustible common fund of calumnies employed by Jaures'
enemies. One day in June 1912 he opposed the Moroccan policy of
the Caillaux government, only to be told by the minister of foreign affairs, "With you, Monsieur Jaures, it is always France who
is in the wrong." A familiar tune which has come down to us and
*
is trotted out against us when needed. Meline and Deroulede
both sang it a few years earlier, each in his own way: Meline
accused Jaures of "inciting soldiers to rebel against their leaders,"

and Deroulede proclaimed that he considered him

to

be "the most

odious corruptor of public conscience ever to have played the

enemy's game." Traitor. The word had not yet been uttered, but

One evening at Saint-Privat when we were talking of friendship, Claude Manceron spoke endlessly on the subject of this
scene and of the love which bound Lucile and Camille. I asked,
"Why Lucile?" She had written to Robespierre to protest, to beg.
In reply she had been arrested, sentenced, and executed in her

Houphouet-Boigny. This young doctor, who was his country's
deputy in the French National Assembly, had made himself hated
by the white settlers for having organized a trade union of black
planters. He was president of the Democratic African Assembly,
whose members had established connections with the Communist
group. The government in Paris had decided to eliminate him by
any means and he had been forced to flee so as to escape the
repression practiced on the spot by a strong-arm governor. He
was reported to be hiding in his native village of Yamoussoukro,

the country's hostility to joining the Common Market ousted the
Socio-Democrats, who had been in favor of joining, from power
in 1973. They were out of power less than a year. At the next
elections, they again obtained a majority and returned in force to
the direction of public affairs. It was also in 1973 that Denmark

The partial elections having forced me to cram into the last week

came to Paris to present his book, The Story of My Life. I regret not
having seen that exceptional character. At the beginning of October we had lunched together in Tel-Aviv as guests of Shimon
Peres, the minister of defense, and had planned to meet again.
During the course of the meal Peres had expressed the wish that I
waive the precautions of usage and language and give my real
opinion on Israel's policy. He pressed me "not to leave Israel
without having asked the questions which you put to yourself/' I
took advantage of this invitation to deplore the hostility shown by
its

leaders to the creation of a Palestinian state in Transjordan,

while they assert they would accept, even encourage, the integra-

The conversation veered to the actions of the cia in South
America; to American instructors sent to train the cadres of local
armies, and to ambassadors whose diplomatic immunity protected a compact network of police and spies. Tejeira felt that
Watergate, the coming to office of Carter, and the wave of moralism which had taken hold of public opinion had made the political climate much healthier, and that there was a genuine desire for
change in the United States. But he very much doubted that good
intentions, even if they became common currency in the White
House, would be able to change the habits of the senior officials of
the administration who were the real rulers of the country. T do
not believe that the teams which are just below the best-intentioned government heads will let themselves be eliminated. I can
remember the ambassador who pointed out a little Bolivian colonel named Barrientos, lost among a group of officers, and said in a
low voice, That one will soon be master in his country/ Eight
days later, Barrientos' coup d'etat succeeded. In Latin America
dozens of would-be dictators like him are available, and in Washington there are plenty of specialists to pick them out several
lengths ahead of history."

Rakosi, but loved by the people, formed a government; Janos Kadar was at his side. He was now secretary general of the Party and
a universally respected leader just released from the prisons of the

Thanks to this tragic story I was able to understand this
remark made by Kadar, talking as though to himself: "Which is
more terrible in a man's life? To be made to suffer by one's friends
or by one's enemies? Prison under Horthy or prison under Rakosi? Torture under Rakosi or torture under Horthy? The worst is
to doubt one's friends. Horthy deprived me of my physical freedom, but over and above that, Rakosi deprived me of my moral
freedom." Then he added with a half smile, "I know of a worse
